False	You sound like an animal lover too.  Any pets?
False	I do love animals. We currently have a dog and a cat. How about you? Did you ever get another rabbit?
True	Same on the dog and cat.  The dog was a stray named Blue.  The cat is a rescue named Smores. No more rabbits, for now.
False	We found our cat at the park one day, she was a skinny little kitten. She has been the best pet!
False	Awe!  I bet she is sweet.  What is her name?  What color is she?
False	She is black and her name is Moon. I never had a cat growing up but they really are so easy to care for.
False	Now Moon is the coolest name for a cat.  It's really unique, especially for this time of year. They are easy.  
True	No more pets for us for a while. We live on a lake so we get to see plenty of wild life around here, that's enough for me.
False	I bet it's beautiful.  I have always wanted to live on the water.  What area - if you don't mind me asking?
True	We live in the Midwest, it is beautiful here. I don't ever think about leaving.
False	I want her to still be my little panda,thats what i call her because i love them so much.lol
False	Haha! That is so cute!
True	i remember when she was a baby just sitty on the beach ready books.They grow so fast.
True	They do grow up quick.
False	I just hope she makes the right decisions in life.
False	I hope so too. 
False	The world is a different place now
False	It definitely is.
False	I live on the beach so when i relax i loving reading there,but now all these kids are rowdy,so i stay in
True	I wish I lived near the beach. 
True	It's been so long since I've had a good seafood boil. At the bar, we just have the cocktail shrimp.
True	Some people are allergic to seafood
False	I know, it's so unfortunate! I couldn't imagine life without crab legs and mussels.
False	I donâ€™t think i could eat something with legs everywhere!
False	Are you a vegetarian?
False	No i eat animals, but not ones that come out of the sea... four legs is ok but eight?
True	Haha! I totally understand. What's your favorite dish?
False	I like pizza, but not with shellfish on, it brings me out in a rash! What is your favourite dish?
False	I can always go for a good pasta dish. I made some Thai basil zucchini noodles and they were delicious!
False	They sound delicious! Are you a vegetarian?
False	Cycle of life. But it would just be helpful. Therefore, I wouldn't be sitting around waiting, hoping, expecting.
False	It would be helpful. How hard is it for them to make a personal message you know. We took the time to fill out the application you know. 
False	Exactly! Have you had this experience lately or been in a long-term situation?
False	I recently got a rejection letter that was really vague and unhelpful from a company. 
True	Well, I've been reading self-help books, lately. Working on me, how to write a winning resume, make them notice you, type of thing. I figure it's good for life.
True	Yeah, I think self help books can be helpful in every avenue. Which one are you reading?
True	Resume help for dummies. Enough about me. I hate to be a complainer - thank you for letting me share that and get it off of my shoulders. :-D
False	No problem. Its healthy to vent and tell people things that are bothering you. 
False	What are you into? what are you up to, lately? Read any good books?
False	I enjoy drawing and I havent found any good books lately but I am into Gillian Flynn and love her writing. 
False	Yep.. they actually used to be called ORVs.. (I learned that from Goonies)
False	Well I didn't know that but i like that film! I'v seen it a million times.
True	Me too.  We actually were in a heavily modified SUV Land Rover last year in Africa on Safari
False	Oh wow! I've always wanted to do that. Would be nice to see powerful animals outside of a zoo!
True	It was an amazing experience.. we were on a hunting / conservation trip so I actually got to shoot a lion (for a good cause)
False	That makes for a good story! Don't know if i could do that though, can barely kill a spider
False	Yeah, it was definitely an interesting experience.  When I got back home, I built a small clay diorama of the experience (I do clay modeling)
False	That sounds like a fun project! I took a pottery class once but one of my dogs knocked my masterpiece over soon after I brought it home. 
True	Aww, that stinks.  Dogs are awesome pets but they can definitely be a bit clumsy.  But yes, clay sculpting is a lot of fun and very therapeutic.
True	They definitely can be! I have three so can be a bit hectic at times. Should definitely show me some of your work sometime.
False	tell me more about it
False	they eat a lot of crickets and dubia roaches, also there are 40 different families of them
True	can you name some of them
True	Komodo Dragon, Mexican Beaded Lizard, and the Gila Monster
False	that is awesome I wish I could go see them
False	you can at many zoos and even just in the wildlife you can get lucky and find a few
False	I may go this weekend with the family 
False	go during the day that is when they are most active
True	I will do that thanks for the advice
True	you are welcome, any kind of animal or such you like?
True	what kind of clothing do you like?
True	I like dresses alot, especially the ones from American Eagle Outfitters
False	cool, do you like ones that have crazy prints?  that's the kind of clothing i like
False	I prefer the black ones that have zippers on the side and also a pair of pull on ones. I like to go out wearing pretty dresses to eat pizza.
False	pizza is great!  what's your favorite topping?
True	I like pepperoni the most! 
False	same here!
False	Yeah pepperoni is pretty good. Pizza is one of the most popular foods in the whole world. PIzza and shopping. You can't beat that combo.
False	no you certainly cant.
False	I can't wait to goto shopping in all these stylish stores. 
False	Yes, I am desperate for both me and him that it get approved. 
False	It's such a shame - the organisation that won the space race might be in jeopardy
False	Working in a doctors office helps with getting the correct information for my intolerance
False	Yeah. We should not consume more lactose as it has adverse effects on our body. 
False	Definitely!  What do you use an alternative to lactose?
False	Well, I always consume milk products in alternative to lactose. That works good for me.
True	Lactose is the sugar component of milk.  You should try banana milk; it's not that bad!
False	Of course I will love to try that. But it costs more I guess. What about the other alternative?
False	They have all sorts.  Banana, rice, soy, oat, coconut, cashew, almond,  lactose free, etc.  
False	Sounds great. I will try these too. How are you managing your diets with all these stuffs?
False	Carefully.  It's very time consuming, but not feeling sick makes it all worth it in the end.  I need my health to continue school. 
False	Yeah, its very vital for us to continue our life with fit and healthy. I will let you know once I tried this stuffs.
False	Why not, they make any dish so much better
False	I just don't know how to prepare them I guess.
False	You can always find fun ways to cook them on the internet
True	I suppose but I never learned to cook and I would just rather eat a burger.
False	I like to cook because I can save some money and still have a good meal.
False	I just buy frozen burger patties and throw them on the george forman. Just like my dad before he got locked up.
True	Do you just eat burgers or do you have anything with them
False	Usually a salad from a bag but I don't care for it.
False	I think if you branched out a bit you would find something you enjoy
False	Maybe, but who has that kind of time
False	Oh wow I've always dreamed of a restaurant, I love to cook especially for my family.
False	I love cooking. Thinking about becoming a chef. I love the way food brings people together.
True	I personally love cooking desserts the most. Good thing I have a dog so I can take him on long walks to walk all the calories off!
False	You are so right about that.  I like to eat and limiting calories I eat is quite difficult.
False	I agree, the best foods is the most calorie dense!
False	So true. I always eat it all. 
False	It's hard because my wife likes to split all the time
True	yes i believe it lol ! so what kind of food do you like ? i am craving italian !
False	I could really go for some pasta! I'm always craving pizza though lol
False	We just had pizza last night with the family. My kids love it!
False	You do? Who is your favorite artist?
True	I dont really play favorites. I like variety, since im actually a middle school art teacher
False	Awesome! I always loved Degas when I was younger since I took ballet.
True	I dont know much about ballet to be honest.
True	I danced for over 10 years, but it's not my favorite genre of dance. A great base, but too strict.
False	I suppose that makes sense. Also, the differences in dances around the world is something that intrigues me. So many cultures
False	The different cultural dances are so beautiful. I'm in love with Caribbean and Chinese styles of dance and stroytelling.
False	I also find Indian dance and Japanese dance fascinating. I love the different costumes and moves they use.
False	Yes, the costumes are so colorful!
False	I wonder what dance was like in ancient Egypt. Dance has existed for millennia, surely it existed then. 
False	What type should I start with? There are so many to choose from!
True	Well first you have to decide if you like brown or white rice or even just seaweed.
True	Hm, I've had seaweed salad before and enjoyed that! And I like white rice better than brown. 
True	The California roll is a great one for sushi! Classic!
False	I'll try that next tim! What other dinners would you suggest? I'll be at a sci-fi convention in the city and doing more dining out than normal.
False	Can't go wrong the sushi and steak special. A classic in Alaska.
False	Awesome! I was surprised that they have a convention in Alaska. Are you planning on going?
True	I wish! I hear it will it be an interesting and fun experience!
True	I think so! I always like seeing the different co-players even though I'd never be brave enough to dress up!
False	You should most certainly give it a try when you go ! If I could go I would dress up as Jade from Mortal Kombat! lol
True	I used to be in advertising, but I am a stay at home mom now.
False	Thats cool. I went to school for marketing. how do you like being a stay at home mom?
False	I am a people person, so it is certainly hard to not be working full time, but my girls are awesome so I have learned to love it
False	that's great to hear, how many children do you have?
False	Its and old Ford.   Where are you from?
False	I'm from Germany. What about you?
False	I'm from Mississippi.  I bet Germany is beautiful.  Do they have good food?  I love to cook.
False	The food is okay.  I do not enjoy cooking, I prefer eating.
False	I like that part the most.  Hows the weather there?
False	Not too bad. It is cold and rainy. I enjoy the weather
False	I love the snow.  I wish we had cooler weather here. 
True	We don't get much snow here maybe one good day.
False	Its hot in the south.
False	i would think it is too hot .
True	Do you like dogs
False	Yeah, I absolutely love them, how about you?
True	When you said you dyed it black for a role it reminded me of my favorite black dog
False	Ah, makes sense, is he or she still around today?
True	No, unfortunately he passed away while I was at work one day. 
True	I'm sorry to hear that, that must've been a rough thing to come home to.
True	Yeah, it was but I will always remember him. 
False	That's good at least, it's hard to forget them since they end up feeling so much like family.
True	Oh yeah that is for sure and because of my job I could not get back right away when he was sick
True	Yeah, it's tough balancing work and pets at times
True	I've been thinking about them a lot, especially on my long drive to and from work. They make me crazy.
True	how so?
True	They are hoarders. They hang on to everything. Going from the kitchen to the living room is like going through a junk yard!
True	do you live with them still? that sounds rough
False	My mom is disabled and my father is getting senile, so they live with me and my family. 
True	that has to be rough. props to you for stepping up like that. 
True	Thanks, as much as they drive me crazy, I don't want them to end up in a nursing home. It's just tough some days. What are your parents like?
True	Difficult. We don't see eye to eye on a lot, but they don't live with me so its easier
False	I understand. My dad and I don't agree about anything. Arguing is our favorite father/son activity lol
True	I try to put limits on it. Or make excuses to get off the phone.
True	oh, i'm doing a package tour
True	So, there's no hike included at all?
True	I'm hope so, probably as an additional excursion. 
True	Yah, more money, right?  I can't imagine being gone for that long.  My cats would miss me.
True	Always more money lol. If you wanted to travel, could a trusted person look after the cats?
False	Possibly.  I might be able to get someone to come stay with them, take care of the cats and the yard.
True	My mother does that for me, she also looks after my grandmother.  I'll miss them. 
True	How soon are you leaving?
True	Next month, so time to get all my ducks in order lol
True	Lots of time.  How is your grandmother doing?  Does she still watch The Voice every week?
False	I thnk people would wait in line to hear me sing
False	That is great! I am not a big fan of waiting in line. My patience
True	being patient is always a good thing.
True	I do hear that. I just have no patience for long lines and crowds
True	I understand just breath.  what about driving and road blocks
False	I also like to sing, it calms my anxiety. Road blocks, hmmm traffic and road blocks really test me
True	sometimes I humm songs to myself just to keep calm. it does also help with depression
True	Nice, I do the same thing! We have something in common!
True	Great!
True	Now I am not so sure my voice is line ready lol
True	Texas. Where are you from? 
True	Alabama, I have lived here my whole life. I have family in Texas and stayed there for a summer many years ago.
False	You know how hot summers are here then. Im just glad its getting close to Christmas. I love it!
True	Yes! Even hotter than here and Florida. I prefer cold weather, would love to move more north in the future.
False	My daughter loves the hot weather. Is it humid in Alabama?
True	Very humid. I loved going to Mount Rushmore and seeing how it was 97 but I barely broke a sweat. Dry heat was great.
True	I agree. Dry heat is much better than humidity. Not too humid in my part of the state though
True	That's good. The heat outside makes me glad that I work mostly from home lol.
False	Me too! I love a fire in my fireplace while I work. Cant beat it!
True	That makes me imagine a fire crackling. Very relaxing. Now I feel cozy and ready for bed. Where is the hot cocoa?
False	Good old Heinz, so regular. What's mushroom ketchup?
False	It's fermented napa cabbage, a Korean dish.
False	Hmm, what's it taste like?
False	It is not the most pleasant dish, let me just put it that way haha
True	Haha okay, so are you gonna make meatloaf soon?
False	I probably will. People make meatloaf with beef, pork, lamb, or even veal! So there's a lot of approaches.
False	I have only ever made it with beef. What way do you like best>
False	I like to be unconventional and use lamb, pork, or veal instead of ground beef.
True	Interesting, maybe the kids would be interested to try that sometime, do you have a recipe?
False	My grandmother had a great recipe. I think of her every time I have it now.
False	what other two dimensional mediums do you use?
True	Personally, I like to use graphite and charcoal to create grey-scale photorealistic images.
False	that sounds difficult.  what subjects do you draw?
False	I draw just about anything I mainly like drawing old buildings
False	do you draw from your imagination or use buildings as models?
True	i can do both ,its interesting using older buildings because you can see the different shapes of areas 
False	that sounds like it's fun.  do you use rulers or other tools to draw?
False	I usually just free hand it once you get the points of perspective you are good to go , do you draw?
False	i draw the occasional stick figure or doodle.
False	hay that is a work of art no matter what it is, my mom worked in oil paints I think that is why I like to draw 
True	It could be that they are afraid of us.
False	Or they have visited and the government is just covering it up. 
False	Or they visited, saw what our government is like, and turned right around and went back home. Lol.
False	Hahaha! You're probably not wrong about that! 
True	I'm not sure I would ever want to participate in space travel if it ever became an option to the general public.
False	I agree. Who would even have the money for that?
False	Yes, I'm sure it would be a bit pricier than the average plane ticket.
False	Yep, and think about how long it would take to travel anywhere. 
True	I guess we'll leave space travel to the astronauts and aliens.
False	I'll just stick to watching alien documentaries. 
True	I wish I didn't know that about you.
False	I cannot help of thinking of Bill Cosby when I think of pudding... So sad... Pudding is a great dessert or savory dish.
False	New topic. I love to make houses with nothing but matches.
False	oh , i like making houses with matches . have you ever tried ?
False	Yes, I just said I do. Are you listening to me?
False	I am listening, I promise
True	Do you like to travel?
False	Yes, I like to travel to distant geographical locations by train.
False	Where is your favorite place you've been?
False	Ireland, land of castles.
False	I go to a Catholic school in New England.
False	That's awesome.. I live in Colorado.. I also got my MBA out here in Denver.  Are you studying anything specific?
False	I am trying to get my Nursing degree
False	Nice.  My sister is a Nurse.. she really likes it :)
False	I love helping people and making them smile.
False	That's really important.. and, ESPECIALLY in the medical field, where that 'bedside manner' is a major factor in the healing process.
True	I hope to make a difference someday. Nursing school is very overwhelming at times! I hope i make it through
False	I'm sure you'll do fine.  Positive thoughts bring positive actions.  Just focus on your studies and you'll rock it :)
False	Thank you very much! I really needed that!
True	No problem at all, I think you'll do great.  School's a great experience if you make it fun.. otherwise, it drags :)
False	I feel like I am walking on sunshine from that moment. 
False	I believe it! I hope he made it perfect for you.
False	He did. He was nervous but gave this romantic speech about how I was the one and then got on one knee and I started crying.
False	That is very sweet. Will you have alcohol at your wedding? I've never had any.
False	I dont know yet. I havent started planning but I am putting together an pintrest page on what I want. 
False	Good idea. I love Pintrest. If I were getting married I'd love to bring my dog, she is my best friend!
False	He has this cute dog and we are thinking of making him the ring bearer. Wouldnt that be the cutest? 
False	That would be precious! What kind of dog is he?
False	He is a chocolate lab mix and his name is Oliver. What is your dog?
False	Aw! That is so cute! I think Oliver would make the perfect ring bearer! I have a white/brown pit mix named Reese. She has three legs!
False	No, I must have left it open when I went to work. 
False	do you have security cameras that you can check?
False	I do actually. I will check them later
False	I have a Ring, and I love it. 
False	I want to get one of those whenever I buy a new house soon. 
False	I am amazed at how much we use it, even to check for deliveries when we are at work. And the neighboorhood alerts are awesome
False	I love those videos where Ring doorbells capture people falling. 
False	I agree, and the ones where the delivery drivers throw temper tantrums. 
False	I havent seen those but they sound really funny. 
False	They get caught saying some pretty funny things, I wouldn't want to explain to my boss
False	What do you do for work?
False	I'm a nurse, on the night shift.. In my scrubs right now. Almost time to leave. You?
False	Im a football coach for the high school
True	Wow! that seems exciting. You get to prepare the next NFL players, and hopefully, have scouts come watch your team. Did you play ball in high school or college?
False	I played in high school, did you play at all?
True	No. Not at all. I'm a bookworm. Not athletic at all.
False	Oh haha, have you read the passage?
False	The passage, meaning book? No I have not heard of it. Who's the author? It's interesting that it is a title you recall so quickly. It must've been very intriguing.
False	Im not sure about the author, i just remember seeing it on tv and it was based on a book.
False	Oh interesting. I'm not the greatest with keeping up with books, lately. Did you think the book or show was better?
False	I do live in a big city, tons of people. However, I never feel closed in- I feel like the opportunists are boundless. Especially after graduating college. 
False	oh, wow! congratulations! what was your major?
False	My major was American literature and education. Aiming to make it big in the the big city. Where are you from?
True	nashville, tennessee! the great music city!  the population has boomed. it's like a little new york city.
True	That is a great city! I used to live up north in Kentucky. Always loved to visit the beautiful city of Nashville!
False	kentucky is beautiful country. lots of land.  do you miss kentucky?
False	Everyday, thats where my family lives. Is Nashville where you were born?
False	no. i was born in birmingham. i don't miss it, though.
False	Oh ok, also visited birmingham... Would much rather be in Nashville as well ;)
False	right! nashville is awesome. lots of opportunity.
False	Nope, 500 page novel for 5 hours
False	That sounds unnecessarily intense.
False	As intesnse as a panera bread can get
False	For me cooking is intense. I stay up all night cooking quite often.
False	Thats why you dont mix weed with adderall
False	I hear that stuff is bad for you.
False	You heard right
False	Sometimes the bad is the most fun, though. Unfortunately.
False	Thats why brown foods are delish
False	That's the truth.
False	Really, i am not heared about it
False	It's a really niche topic since it has recently gained a lot of negative reputation from its fanbase.
False	ok , can you elaborate more about techno ?
False	It's an electronically created music that really took off in Detroit, Michigan in the 1980's
False	ok, if it is a melodious music that why it gain negative reputation ?
True	Because the fans that enjoy it tend to be less appreciated by society due to their eclectic choices
False	ok ,you are fan of this music or not ?
True	Not exactly a fan, but I like to learn about all sorts of things.
False	ohh.. you are great person. I like to learn about animation related things
False	Animation is a fun topic! Do you do any animation yourself?
True	I do a lot of volunteer work with rescue dogs!
False	You sound like a very generous person. You got kids?
True	I do not yet, thankfully! I am a little young for that right now.
False	That's smart. I'm in school, work, and have a daughter.
True	I am in between classes in school right now and working to pay for them is stressful enough, I can't imagine doing this all with a daughter in tow!
False	Yeah, totally. She's three. Can't get enough attention.
False	I couldn't either at that age!
True	It's hard. I wish I could give her my whole day.
False	It's hard when you can't give someone the attention you want to, I have dealt with that myself, just not with children.
False	I bet you deal with it in your volunteer work, though.
True	I am fascinated with Greek culture because that is where my Mother is from. Do you travel often?
True	Yes it is a great culture, I do, every year 
True	I love to travel as much as possible. Have you ever been to India?
True	No, I have not, its in my bucket list
True	I have been there a few time. My Father is from India. I need to create a bucket list.
False	That is great, and yes you should I believe its easier to accomplish with goals 
True	First thing on my bucket list is travel to Germany for Oktoberfest. What are some other things on your bucket list? 
True	Great, next thing on my bucket list is to travel to Santorini Greece
True	That is a good idea. Very beautiful. Another bucket list for me is to play a zombie in a movie or TV show.
True	That sounds like fun, I had a friend that does extras in movies
False	Thats cool.  What is your favorite type of fish?
True	I've always been a sunfish man.
False	That's cool, I like the simple goldfish!
True	Goldfish bring back bittersweet memories of innocence and loss.
False	Really, why is that?
True	They are harmless creatures who wind up imprisoned in bowls. They give sad lessons on death.
True	That is very true.  I like fish in the ocean, mainly dolphins
True	The joy of catching sunfish is giving them a chance to be out of the ocean. In direct sunlight.
True	Exactly! I don't like people who fish and keep them to eat.  They belong in the ocean!
True	Then we must disagree, for I am a proud fisherman who loves nets and hooks.
True	i don't sew very well, so no, i don't sew much.  i like to work with clay.
True	The first thing I made in pottery class was supposed to be a mini cactus pot. I use it as an ashtray now lol
False	an ashtray is very functional.  i have many!
True	That's so true. That ashtray is 16 years old
True	do you take classes other than pottery?
True	no i haven't been in school for many years . how about you ?
True	no school for me either.  classes were hard for me to stay awake through
True	i hear that, i drank a lot of coffee while i attended classes and even that didn't help some days.
True	i wasn't able to make it through a full semester of college.  did you go to college?
True	I did attend college, but I am one of those statistics you hear about....a dropout. I just preferred to be at home baking or sewing instead.
False	Hey! its good to know you. Have you ever been to Paris before?
False	I have never been to Paris. A friend just came back and said it was a great experience.
False	So what are you plans for Paris visit?
False	I do plan to go to Paris within the next five years. I am putting aside some vacation money to do that with my husband.
False	I never been to Paris before but my folks visited Paris and said it is very very expensive.
False	Quite expensive, that is why I have to save my money for a few years before taking that trip.
False	Good move, Though I have saved enough for the trip but not sure in case of emergency I can make it or not.
True	I hope you do get that chance to visit Paris. Maybe we can coordinate and visit at the same time. 
False	Oh why not. I am interested in visiting those specialized boutiques in Paris which arrange special ramp walk for even individual customers.
False	That sounds like a lot of fun. I can't wait.
True	when I have a tough decision to make I go for long walks on the beach
True	Sounds good, for me it was playing a guitar that gives pease of mind.
False	you play the guiter? I like pop music
False	On my younger years I played it more though, 
True	you need to keep it up if you enjoy it!
True	The only thing I enjoy is being a primarily a meat eater lol
False	I am a big bbq fan, great food all around
False	There's no denying that
False	I cant imagine anyone being a vegan
True	Me neither, I think its more like a status like Oh look at me I'm sparing the animals kinda thing
False	I spend so much cash going to a little Italian restaurant near my house. That have the best pasta!
False	do you cook?
False	I love to cook, it has made me go bankrupt at one time, but now I cook almost daily!
False	do you cook italian food?
False	Oh, yes. I cook pasta a lot and my son loves to help me make homemade pizza. Do you cook Italian?
False	Yes, I love to cook! I have 4 sons, they rarely help me make anything.
False	Aww, it is a great family activity. We have a lot of fun and it makes my son feel like a big boy.
False	I bet, how old is he?
False	He is 5 and thinks he is 10. Haha1
False	Such a fun age. Is he your only one?
False	a couple more tickets and maybe a drink
False	gotcha, I could go for a drink,but it cuts into my gym time.
False	gym time is always a good place to go. i could use some of that myself
False	Maybe you could cycle to work.  It is an efficient mode of transportation, so you can workout while also being productive,
True	if it wasnt so far then i might think about it
False	Well a lot of places in the world use bikes as the primary form of transportation.  I guess they save a lot on gas
False	that they do, and i bet a few many are in good shape for that
False	certainly, many do not even wear helmets, which does not help
False	well that is being reckless, you need a helmet no telling what could happen
False	i did not think of that lol , i guess your right
False	Do you not like the cold weather there?
False	I do, I just don't want to be out in it. 
False	I would love to spend the day indoors reading. Whats your favorite genre?
False	Any genre fiction really, mainly sci-fi, horror and magical realism. How about you?
False	Psychological thrillers are my favorite!
True	I love psychological thrillers, any recommendations?
True	i havent read that one...maybe i will get a copy...i can certainly afford it.
False	It is a very interesting story. Have you read any other Dickens novels?
False	well the christmas carol...but i suppose everyone has read that :)

True	I hope you are right! I'm still freaked a bit though. 
False	I would be too. You should talk to her about the cheating and also make her understand how worried you are
True	I don't know what to say to her. She has a way of making it all about me. Like I shouldn't have looked at her phone.
False	Well trust is earned. she shouldnt give you reason to doubt her
True	I thought I was being paranoid. I don't trust easily. This just screwed me up more. I will try man. Thanks
False	regardless of what she says about you checking phone, fact remains you were right and she cheated. you deserve better
True	Everyone tells me that. Maybe you all are right. Regardless of the test outcome. I need to take a good look at myself.

False	take care and spend time with her . we could all be gone tomorrow .
False	No kidding. Forget my birthday, I might just set up a nice evening for her.

False	Yes, that sounds like a great idea! I would totally be down to do something like that.
True	we just have to pick a date on when we're going sign up or else I'm gonna forget, honestly one of the few bad character traits that I have.
True	For sure. That's okay, that's what friends are for, to help you where you lack.

False	I think about it all year round I really like Christmas time, especially when it snows.
False	It doesn't snow around where I live so it's hard to get in the Christmas mood with warmer weather

False	Well that is cool to be in a band. I like to sing and wish I could play an instrument.
True	What kind of music do you listen to?
False	That reminds me. We had to learn about the light spectrum recently. Frankly, I am no fan of that science stuff. Too much to wrap my head around
False	I am always curious to understand things. But some things are better left unknown.
True	I'm more of an artsy type person. When painting pictures, I try to use purple as much as possible in a way that looks pleasing, such as a late sunset
False	Lovely! In Europe and the US, purple is always associated with royalty, magic and mystery.
True	That is one of the many reasons I love purple. My main reason for loving the color is that it gives me a calming sensation
False	I love it because it's such a royal color. It makes me feel like a queen.
False	If there is anything I should buy that comes in purple, I buy the purple one
False	Why not? Purple is the best color to be associated with!
False	I totally agree! I honestly surprised how few people like purple

True	I agree. I coach football and that's a message I tell my players.
False	That's awesome, I haven't played sports in a while but I've been thinking about volunteering for my local youth club, they currently need more referees
False	You should try it! Get some experience and you'd be more qualified than the NFL referees.
False	I'm really considering it, especially since I could take my kid there to get some quality playing time
False	You should do that! I'm sure your kid would love it. My brother used to referee at the youth club.
False	Cool, how flexible are the schedules? It's hard to balance things with my job and toddler
False	I would have to ask my brother. He still lives in my hometown, Syracuse.
False	nature can make you feel at peace
False	There is nothing better than a warm day with a glass of tea in one hand and a good book in the other
False	I can agree only if you add a good movie in that equasion
True	I like a good movie, but I love a good book. I love books so much I even work in a store that buys and sells sed books.
False	I have an older brother who works in a bookstore!
False	I hope he enjoys it as much as I do.
False	I work in bookstore as well, and i must say. He enjoys it much more than me. Don't mistaken me i love to read.
False	So what do you do with yourself?
False	I enjoy watching scary movies, reading thrillers, and relaxing 
False	Relaxing I can handle. I do not enjoy anything scary.
False	So messed up that I can't wait to see what happens next!
False	No kidding! Same
False	I listened to a podcast about the show and they seem to think the next episode will be a great one
False	I would love to listen to more podcasts especially while im out on my daily runs. 
False	That's the main time I listen as well
False	Awesome! I am also looking for a second job. Any clue on who is hiring?
False	I am pretty set in my current employment so I haven't looked recently. Have you tried zip recruiter or indeed?
False	Thats a really good idea. I havent yet... What do you do?
True	I am a sales manager at a local supplies company. What about you?
False	I do sales work! Its not paying the best but its at least paying my bills. Do you like your job?
True	My dad loved cryptic crosswords!  I remember finding them way too hard when I was younger--maybe I should try them again,
False	Definitely! You'll get addicted. It's like a workout for your brain!
True	I'll check them out.  I'd rather do those than anything math related, that's for sure!
False	I can't argue with that! I was never a huge fan of math.
True	I really hated math when I was in school--English was always my favorite.
True	My favorite class in school was always art. I love painting, drawing, and I would even crochet during my other classes.
False	That's awesome! Hey, speaking of painting, did you know it's Bob Ross' birthday today? 
False	I didn't know that! I loved watching his show when I was younger. So serene!
False	He was a truly exceptional human being.  His show was almost like engaging in meditation (and I'm not even artistic--I can't draw at all!).
False	I probably should have followed along with the show, but I just loved watching. 'Happy little trees' made for a good nap time.
True	Yeah, they stole both of my laptops
False	Oh no. That's scary. Are you ok?
True	Yeah, I think so.  It just is a little disappointing.  I have chocolate to keep me distracted.
False	Chocolate is a good distraction. What kind of chocolate do you have?
True	Hershey's.  It's okay, but I prefer Reese's. 
True	I love Reese's! Best chocolate ever!
False	Yeah! I just wish it wasn't so unhealthy.
False	I know. They have a lot of sugar free candy out now. I tried it. It's not so bad. 
True	Interesting... I will have to look into that.  I eat way more sugar than I know I need.
True	Don't feel bad. I do too. But I'll grab some sugar free candy from time to time. 
True	Yes, he did exceptionally, he join the soccer team
False	Awesome! Is he getting plenty of playing time?
True	Oh yes, he is getting plenty of playng time. 
False	Xbox? :)
True	I think my favorite path to run is through central park what about you?
True	I love it there, it is so calming and peaceful. Except when you end up stuck in traffic in Pigeon Forge. haha
False	Oh wow that seems like a very long run.. from NYC to TN
True	haha. I was referring to the gang of pigeon's in NY.
False	Oh I understand now! Yeah, but they are better than the geese
True	they can be a turn off for running in the parks, and make me consider running on the treadmill, but love the action of outdoors.
True	I do too it just isn't the same on the treadmill. You cant replace the feeling of the cool crisp NY air
True	Yeah, running in outdoors is more satisfying to me. So colorful. Fuels an artist's imagination.
True	Ahh so you are an artist! WHat is your preferred method of crafting?
True	a teacher, but I dabble on my own time, of course, on the canvas.
True	Personally I am not a big fan of all the humidity
True	Yes, neither are my cats! Their hair is so thick it can get unruly
True	Oh you have cats! Adorable! I love cats. My little black cat loves to sit outside and hunt lizards on the porch
True	That's adorable! I love my cats like they are my children.
False	I am the same way.
True	They enjoy it much better than where I grew up, in North Dakota.
True	North Dakota huh? I grew up in Canada actually, my dad is canadian.
False	That is cool! Everyone that comes from there is so tough when it comes to the cold.
True	I love the cold, its why i hate the heat so much
False	That is totally understandable
False	Do you collect anything?
True	no i don't collect anything. However, I am into traveling. I come from a big city. Which city did you find the antique store? I love treasure hunts. :-)
True	I went with one of my brothers to get a tattoo in Ponchatoula, we went into the antique store next to the tattoo shop.
True	i am so jealous!!! that sounds amazing. on a teacher's salary I don't get out of town often, but when I do...visit exotic, unheard of places-priority.
True	That's fun. I don't get to travel much either because I have two dogs I would have to board. 
False	awww I've always wanted a dog. I've only had cats, which I love, but you can't really bring them places. :-(
False	paris and switzerland...

False	what is your favorite place?
True	The Hyatt Place because it has a lit of different sights and museums.

True	it is.. good .. big portions and a reasonable price
False	then i will plan for christmas
True	Yeah you definitely should, there is a lot of great restaurants as well.

False	yeah that was probaly for the best. 
False	I agree. Do you have any kids?
True	yeah two.  a boy and a girl.
True	I've got three. Twins with Aspergers and their older brother.
False	wow. they mustbe a handful at times. but bring a magical smile to your face at others.
True	Yeah it can be a challenge but kids are worth it.
True	i agree. i love to take my children swimming.
True	Mine don't like swimming, but we like going to the zoo a lot. Do you have an indoor pool to go to in the winter?
True	nah, i live in the tropics, we dont really have a winter. whats there favorite animal to see? 
True	My two best friends
True	That's cool! Do you play basketball frequently?

False	Thats awesome!
False	What do you do for fun?
True	I like to read
False	Who is your favorite author?
True	Karen Marie Moning, Her fever series is my absolute favorite! Do you read?
True	I do. My favorite author is Stephen King.
True	Awesome! I have read a few of his books, they are good
True	Wait. Is that seriously his name? I thought it was legit Bruno Mars.
False	Lol, well isnt his BIRTH name but it was one his parents used a child for him.
False	Dang, you're right. I looked it up on Wikipedia. Didn't know that. Learn something new everyday I guess. Hah
False	lol TRUTH!, I think the MAIN buzz is the fact he Hispanice by origin, born in Hawaii and raised in LA. crazy childhood.
False	That's crazy for sure. It must be nice to be born in Hawaii though. Don't think I'd ever be able to leave. 
True	Oh you would. I was stationed there in the Navy. Keep in mind it keeps filling with people and there is nowhere for them to expand to.
False	I don't think that's so bad. Eventually the main island could be like a little Manhattan with an ocean side paradise surrounding it. Could be kinda cool.
False	Beautiful place for sure don't get me wrong. Fun fact did you know that Bruno got his start as a song writer? 
False	Makes sense. Most singers usually write their own stuff starting out. Usually it's not very good though, hence the switch to pros when they get bigger.
False	He had no backing and realized that he could get money ghost writing. 2010 he wrote a song for BOB and the lable wanted him to sing it
True	What is your favorite type of burrito?
True	My favorite is a beef burrito with a lot of guacamole, and cheese.
True	Same here! I love Taco bell, I used to go often when I travel with my band
True	I used to go to Taco Bell a lot but now I prefer the local shops. What kind of music did your band played ?

False	The Story So Far ! I need to check that out. Rush is very good too ! Do you like any other kind of entert
True	I like going to movies when I have the time, especially horror.
True	Horror movies are appropriate for this week. What is your favorite horror movie ?
False	I felt the need to inform others about the scandal and what was going on. I love to gossip, it keeps me on my toes
False	It is good to stay informed.
True	It is one of my quirks along with people saying I am OCD with staying organized all the time
True	it's not a bad thing to be organised, I have to be, I'm a carpenter
True	What an awesome field to be in, I believe you all are so gifted with your hands
True	I used to work in a pub, so glad i escaped to follow my dreams
False	I am sure you heard the gossip that I love to hear while working there
False	OF course I have.

True	Do you go to clubs alot?
True	i make a good amount , yes . nightclubs and concerts . how about you ?
True	On the weekend i go out with friends.
True	What type of clubs do you go to?
True	dance clubs. We 2 step a lot. i love going to eat eggs and bacon for breakfast after the club.
True	That's the perfect combination of activities
False	Do you dance?
True	Yes it's  great cardio
False	No way. Do you watch it very often?
True	I've actually been waiting to binge watch several at once.
True	That's the best way to watch a series.  I like to watch shows while I'm walking on the treadmill.  Takes my mind off exercise.
True	And it also keeps you from having to wait till the next week to see what happens. Karate is good exercise. Have you ever tried it?
True	No, I haven't.  Do you practice karate?  It looks like fun. 
True	I am a black belt. I'm thinking about becoming an instructor but I'm not sure whether I'd be good at it.
True	Wow.  I'm impressed.  You should go for it.  You never know until you try. 
True	Well, maybe I will. Do you have any dreams to do something new and exciting?
True	Next on my horizon is retirement.  I have 4 more years of working.  Not sure what I'll do then.
True	Retirement sounds exciting to me. I bet you're looking forward to having time you can spend however you like.
True	No note, they don't want me to know who they are. I will have to use my own insurance to get it fixed.
True	That's a shame. I had a situation where my dogs scratched my car and I need to pay to fix it myself
True	I guess these things happen to all of us from time to time. Maybe I'll ask one of my 4000 Facebook friends for recommendations for a good body shop.
True	Wow that's a lot. I'm sure you'll receive great recommendations. I am studying astronomy, but I don't know much about cars
False	That is great maybe I should tell my son
False	You should definitely consider it.  They are good with kids, but keep in mind, they typically have a thick coat that sheds frequently.
False	Armilldillos are like wart hogs and an cross between ant eaters.
False	Like those scrawny penguins? That would make me want to bench press a polar bear. !
False	I love animals but raw power of watching them chase people.. and the hype
False	Zoom, zoom. They need to keep up with me and try my super armadillo recipe. Hope they are ok, and not too weak.
False	i used to be able to walk to her home, but i have to drive over an hour now
False	that's a long drive may be she miss you too

False	thank you.  i just found out that my boyfriend is flying her and i on a surprise trip together!
False	wow that's amazing ....have a nice trip and enjoy together
False	thank you.  do you like to walk for fun or health reasons?
False	i like to do if i have a company ...i like to talk and walk
False	I like to eat too thats why I walk twice a day
True	"Walking is good!  I used to run, or ""jog"" some years ago.  I try to ride a bicycle as regularly as I can these days."
False	Riding a bike is great exercise!
False	"Indeed, and fun, but I say every trip I go on is ""uphill both ways"", lol."
False	haha feels that way walking some days too. what else do you enjoy doing?
True	My first passion is flying RC aircraft.  Planes, helicopters and recently fpv quadcopters.
False	That sounds like a fun hobby. I paint airplanes and helicopters sometimes. 
False	Cool!  Wish I could paint!  I like music as well and am currently building a Cigar Box Guitar.
False	Anyone can paint! You should try it. Do you play the guitar?
False	I play some, mostly I make up my own tunes.  Not good at figuring out popular tunes to cover.
True	i'm actually a college student
True	I'm a first year student myself. Huge fan of Harry Potter (the books specifcially)! What's your favorite book to read?
True	Awesome. My favorite book is The Citadel, it's a novel centered around medical ethics.
False	I've never heard of it myself but it sounds interesting for sure. What are you majoring in?
True	I'm majoring in Computer Science, you?
True	Business administration management. I was originally looking to study the field of virtual reality but figured this business admin may be a little more secured in terms of job availability.
False	Ohh. Virtual reality is amazing and will be huge in the future but I understand your decision.
False	 agree completely but it still needs to be more mainstream for that to happen I feel. Not enough people are adopting it into their daily lives right now.
False	That
False	What made you want to get into computer science?
False	so what is your favorite band?
True	I think Metallica is one of my favorites.
False	Oh I see, Well I'm into more upbeat music, like pop, or rap something that helps me set a good pace when I go running.
False	Metallica can actually be pretty upbeat. But yea rap is also good for exercise.
False	if I were to listen to a Metallica song to add my playlist which one would you reccomend? 
False	Master of puppets 100%. It's a classic and very good to run to.
False	ok , awesome! Thank you . I will defintley be checking it out. I am always looking for new music to add.
False	Sweet. What's your favorite meal to eat? I always love chicken and rice.
True	I actually like sea food. so Crab legs, sushi, ,fish. things like that
False	That sounds delicious. I'm more of a chicken guy but the sushi from japan specifically looks so good
False	That's a shame. What else do you enjoy doing? Do you swim?
False	Swimming is really fun and besides it, it is very healthy as it involves all muscles of the body to be engaged in movement I have a swimming pool
True	I agree, I begun swimming when I was young. I like to think I'm fit!
True	With my job it can be difficult sometimes to find time for swimming and my two pit bulls
False	That's fair. What are the pit bull's names?
True	Lucy, and Jade - Jade has beautiful blue eyes and lucys are brown
True	Blue is my second favorite color besides purple. How old are they?
False	They are 13 and 10.  Thank you!
False	Do they ever go in your swimming pool?
True	Not really. They are more lazy than anything, but when they were younger, they did all the time
False	Very interesting, I'm glad I live where I do. 
False	It happened long time ago in India. Now it's changing
True	That is good to know, I used to work for someone who was born in India.
True	Oh, That's nice. I am from India. currently studying at Australia
False	Wow, I had no idea. How do you like Australia?
True	It's amazing. But, sometimes, I do miss India
False	I am sure you do, but you are getting a great experience that many of us wish we could have. 
False	oh Thank you, Where are you from?
True	From the USA, and I always dreamed of going to Australia. I heard they have some great fishing there. 
False	Yes, you should definitely visit Australia. 
True	Well, actually my husband wanted me to eat healthier, even though I think steak is healthy.
True	We eat steak at least once a week, but I know it isn't necessarily healthy.
True	It is filled with protein, so I believe it is good for you if you eat it once a week. 
True	Yes, but I know a vegetarian diet is so much better, the problem I would have is I don't like vegetables.
True	I love vegetables, they are great in salads or eaten as a side dish. 
True	I like salads, which is probably the only vegetables I really like.  But, I think the protein from meat is important too.
False	Yes, protein is very important for your health, and for building lean body mass. 
True	I live in the south where everything is fried!  At least I do grill almost all the meat I eat, including the steak.  
False	Fried food is not good for you. Grilling is a good way to go when cooking meat. Beans and yogurt are also a good source of protein.
True	Yogurt is okay, but I don't think I could eat enough beans to make up for the loss of proteins.  Have a good day!
False	Those are way harder to deal with than pets.
False	Yes they are sometime, but they are useful right now.
False	How so?
True	I am in a wheel chair, so they help me get around town.
True	Oh yes, I'm sure they are very helpful right now.  Someday I will probably wish I got along with people better than animals.
False	You are not a social type of person?
True	Not really.  I find it hard to relate to people.
False	Some people are pretty cool when you start knowing them.
True	It's just so hard to find a place to meet new people.
False	Think of your favorite hobby, and find a group interested in the same hobby as you in your city. Thats the best way.
True	Dogs are awesome!  We have a dog too.
False	Dogs are a lot of work for sure. Do you have hobbies?
True	I love making crafts.  I have had to set those aside since I've been on bed rest.
False	Oh. What are you on bed rest for? Surely some crafts can be done in bed!
True	I have another child on the way.  This one a bit more difficult, with a lot of morning sickness.
False	Oh wow. Congratulations. how far along? I hope you dont have Hyperemesis! Sorry you have been ill.
True	In my 2nd trimester.  My children are a big help.  My husband is going to buy some crafting supplies to keep us occupied.
False	Children are life's biggest blessing without a doubt. I am glad your family is big help! Family is everything
False	Thank you.  What kind of hobbies do you enjoy?
True	I enjoy surfing! I live right by the beach. And cooking, I'm vegetarian and make most of my meals from scratch.
False	WHen they come back I am refreshed and ready to enjoy them again.
False	Everyone needs to recharge every once in a while.  Children are terrific, but take a lot of energy,
False	Yes, when they are away I love to watch movies. My favorite movie is Pretty Woman. I also love to read.
False	I have gotten addicted to Netflix series Money Heist.  I binge watch.  
True	I love Netflix. I have not watched Money Heist. I am going to have to give it a try.
True	I am on the last season so will watch something else.  I only get to watch a little each afternoon.  
True	I enjoyed watching Mad Men. It was quite an interesting and historical series. 
True	 I might go to that one next. I am retired, which you think would give me plenty of time.
True	I am also retired, but busier than ever. Funny how you find things to fill your time and you wonder how you ever had time to go to work. 
True	I know, we bought a mini-farm when we retired.  There is always something to do.
True	Wow, that's amazing. One of those copies is mine lol
True	My boyfriend loves playing GTA as well he will spend hours on the game console playing.
True	That's awesome. Do you like playing with him?
True	Mostly.  He really has to guide me so I know what to do.  It's a very complex game.
True	It is! My partner doesn't mind watching me play but she gets so bored watching me play football haha
True	The game has been around since 2005, but I've only started playing recently.
True	Oh, nice. It's never too late to start! I've been gaming my whole life
True	I just have to make sure I take a break. They say sitting down too long is bad for you.
True	That's so true. I always try to do something physical between every game
True	I'm a big reader, so I spend a lot of time sitting down no matter what. 
True	I mainly like to read books written for young adults and children. 
True	reading books are great. i also love games that have a great story lore to them
True	What is your favorite game?
True	the final fantasy collection was one of my favorites along with the lore from world of warcraft. 
True	I'm not familiar with those.  Are they board games or video games?
False	Video games.
True	How often do you play video games?
True	a couple times a week and yourself?
True	I don't play video games.  I do like to play Candy Crush on my phone when I'm bored. 
False	still a game and i would consider video game as well. we all play some sort of game it seems
False	That is awful I am sorry to hear that. That must be hard, what will you do?
True	Im not sure! I may follow the work or try to relocate. Times are tough for sure.
True	That is for sure! It is a struggle feeding a family of 7! Our free time is spent visiting parks because they are free!
False	Thats a great point! Parks are always relaxing. Do you go to any national parks?
True	Yes, national parks are our favorite! We don't live very far from the Grand Canyon and go there camping often. 
True	Thats amazing! How much do the passes cost?
True	A vehicle pass is $35 which is great cause you can fill the whole vehicle! Great for a family of 7! Do you have a big family?
True	Not too big. Just 5 in total. I may move out near a park to try to get a job...
False	Fresh open air is always better than sitting behind a desk all day I would say. And there are always new things to see!
True	Thats very true. Life on a farm has me used to freedom, I dont think I could go back to something not as free.
False	Do you think they have monkeys in India?
False	I am not sure. I recently discovered that I love Indian food. Do you?
False	Sure, I love to go out to eat with a huge crowd, especially Indian food.
False	Yum! What do you do for fun! I like to play the violin. 
False	I like traveling and making new friends there. Do you play in a string quartet?
False	No, just for fun at home. where are you traveling next?
False	Africa, to see the gorillas in the mist.
False	Wow! That sounds awesome. I hope you have a great time. 
False	Thanks, I plan to! Where have you traveled?
False	My favorite place besides India is Italy. The pasta was so good!
False	Man, cafeteria pizza is like, the worst kind of pizza. I mean, I'll still eat it, but there's way better. Now cafeteria spaghetti and ematballs, yum
True	Oh no!  Cafeteria spaghetti and meatballs are so gross!  My Grandma's are so much better!  What is your Grandma's best meal?
True	She makes a mean lasagna. Does your grandma cook well?
True	The best!  And her lasagna is sooo good!  And her chicken parm, oh my!  Are you also in the band?
True	Not me, I wanted to try it out but I'd rather do drama more and couldn't fit both in my schedule
False	Oh you do drama, that is so cool!  Do you have a play coming up?
False	Yeah, we're going to do a Midsummer Night's Dream
False	Fun!  I'm sure it's going to be a great show!
False	I think the ticket's only like a buck, you should come see it!
False	Totally, I'd love to!
False	I miss those days. Now, both of my parents practice as lawyers for work.
False	That is important work though! I know they are doing great things
True	Oh no doubt. They love to argue though, maybe partly because of their job lol. I order everything on the internet and they worry about me getting scammed.
False	A completely valid thought, but it is way more convenient
False	What is your work? I work for the government actually and lots of my work is in secret.
True	I run a daycare close to Huntsville!
True	Alabama, huh? I work in Dothan, opposite side of the state. Small world.
True	It is a small world indeed. I love living there
True	I like it here but me and my family wanna move further north so we see snow every year and have four real seasons. It's so hot here.
False	Yeah it can seem like we are stuck in an eternal summer haha
False	You could always dance too
True	I love to dance especially to 80's rock music!  What is your favorite genre of music? 
True	I love rock music but like to dance to hip hop
True	Hip hop is awesome, very high energy! O love dancing to that as well.

False	What are you practicing?
False	Dance for recitals!
False	wow, that's very exciting! 
False	Thank you. My cat was pretty old for a cat, 20. She lived a good life.
False	She lived a long life for a cat but its never long enough for us who they leave behind. I hope you feel better soon...
False	So true. What breed of cats do you have?
True	I love black cats, and all of them really.  I think the manx cat is really cute, they have no tails.
True	My sister-in-law also loves manx cats. I think the hairless cats look kind of neat.
False	yes, you are right !
False	I suppose a plus to having a hairless cat would be not having to worry about the hair getting into everything.
False	very true . maybe i will have to get a cat too .
True	They sure do make for good pets, if you get one with a good temperament. I had one that only liked me when I fed him.
True	True, they are good human companions though. I actually tried to do that once, but my cat was not feeling that!
True	my puppy was 18 years old.  i don't think there is another that can take her place. she was beautiful.
False	Oh goodness, that has to be hard. 18 is a long life for a dog, but it never feels like it's long enough
False	$500.  that's a big win in my book. lol.
True	no kidding! I've never won anything more than another lottery ticket, haha
True	right.  the most i have ever won is another ticket.  i am not lucky when it comes to gambling.
True	Me neither, I'd rather spend my money on something I'll get something out of
False	right. like groceries, or gas for the car or household items.  those things add up.
False	they really do, budgeting is super important, and things like the lottery just don't make the cut most of the time
False	and if you really sit down and think about your odds of winning, that should be enough discouragement from playing. lol!
False	right! In order for one person to win, a whooooole lotta people have to lose
True	LOL! right! and i don't want to be the loser.  i like my belly and my gas tank full.
False	Same here :) it's just not worth the squeeze
True	I still do eat meat, I try to not eat as much but I need to make sure me and my family get the appropriate nutrition.
True	My daughter is thinking about that career track.  Is it hard though when an animal doesn't make it?
False	You just have to be able to adjust your training regime and look back at what went wrong and how you can improve.
False	Do you train any monkeys?
True	No, while I do some exotic animals, monkeys are not really in my wheel house! My wife does the more unusual animals for us.
False	Whats your favorite animal to train?
True	I enjoy training any service animals, they do such great work and live such happy lives.

True	I love the old, sad country music, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings. I'm not up on current music though. I usually listen to podcasts or audiobooks in the car 
False	What audio books are you listening to at the moment? 
True	I just finished Education: A Memoir and trying to decide what to listen to next. Do you like audiobooks?
True	I haven't really tried listening to any. Call me old school but I like having the physical book in hand. Maybe look up something to do with country music? 
False	Lots of people do prefer hardcopy bound books, nothing wrong with that. I dislike driving, so it's a good safe distraction for me to have something to listen to
True	t is a safe distraction alright! I'm 23 and still haven't got my license yet. It gets pretty hard getting around in Tennessee. 
False	Oh I bet. How do you get around? You must live in a downtown area with lots to do within walking distance?
True	I listen to music when I'm at the gym, but when I'm home I like to read
True	When i am at home i like to eat large healthy servings and cardio to burn the calories
False	What do you like to eat?
True	I love some salad! But i also eat alot of un-necessary junk food. Fish and chicken I can live on
True	I can eat literal boatloads of brussel sprouts
True	I have tried brussel sprouts, they are not my favorite! I am more of a broccoli, carrot type of person
True	I love to cook! But boy do they stink up the house!
False	Too funny, I agree! What about exercising? 
True	Ah, nevermind that, I'd rather read comics and eat sprouts.
False	I have read a few comics! What would you recommend?
True	soap opera is alright, i am into a lot of different shows. not an actress though
False	That is ok, it isn't for everyone. What shows are you watching now?
True	various shows, ranging from the office to merlin
True	The office is my favorite show! My favorite character is Dwight

False	i have to agree there. i would love a reboot or a where are they now season of the office
False	Oh I know! There are so many things they could make episodes about nowadays!
False	exactly! the fan base is there, they just need to do it already!
False	I couldn't agree more. Do you recommend any shows that are like the Office?
True	I would like to watch Netflix with my baby in my new sweater but its too small. 
True	Netflix is amazing!  Another show I love that just came back to Netflix in 2017 is Mystery Science Theater 3000.  Have you seen that?
False	No, I can't say that I have. Is it a crime series?
False	I'm not sure. I have only found it about 2 months ago. It's on the Syfy cable network. If you like Sifi or Horror films it's defiantly work watching.
True	I like both of those genres. I think I will check them out. 
False	i definitely recommend it . what do you like to do for fun ?
True	I like long walks on the beach. 
True	my favorite thing to do is shopping , but the beach is also fantastic !

True	I meant cats. Sorry my son is distracting me. I think having a dog is such a joy but a lot of work too.
True	I've never owned pets, but want to try new things, sounds like getting a dog maight be a good idea then
False	I'm glad to hear you want to adopt from the shelter. Saving a dog is so rewarding.
False	I sure hope so I want to do something that matters even if it is only in the life of a dog that needs a home
False	Consider adopting an adult dog. They are most often looked over at shelters and end up being put down. Plus they are usually more well behaved.
False	Thats a good idea! My main hesitation is the responsibility for another life, but an adult dog will probably be more self-sufficient than a puppy
False	yes and normally already potty trained!
True	That would be great since I will want a low maintainence breed of dog
False	I would suggest one with short hair so you do not have to deal with grooming. 
False	yea i am relieved, get to go surfing now!
True	That's cool! I'm interested in the culture of surfing. I love gardening so I'll be spending my day growing new flowers. 
False	what kind of flowers do you like to grow?

True	I am brown. No maybe some highlights.
False	I wouldn't go full blonde.  I think highlights would be nice. 
True	Yes I have a friend that highlights. I will probably go to the same stylist.
True	That can get expensive.  I color my hair to hide the gray.  I can't afford to highlight and get rid of gray :)
False	I know many people who get their hair dyed and do it themselves for a cost effective measure.
False	I've considered it, but I'm scared I would mess it up.
False	There is always a first time for everything. Just do it liek Nike says.
False	I'm not sure what all the traits are that are specific to Gemini.
True	I think you have some unique qualities to you!
True	I have work but i'm doing stuff on the side to make extra money.

False	Yeah they generally freak me out too. So what do you do for a living?
True	I do work on my computer for companies.  It's kind of weird.  What about you?
False	I work as a server at a club. It's super stressful, but it pays well!
False	What kind of club? Like a jazz club or a night club?
False	It sort of changes depending on the night of the week, but I think you'd generally call it a dance club, caters more to younger people
True	Single and living alone.  I like to cook for my friends in my spare time.  Do you live alone?
False	I do and I never had time to go to college either because I had to run my familys farm.

False	at times when i can squeeze some reading in, but I am currently looking for something new to read. Any suggestions?
False	I recently read salvage the bones. It's a novel that follows an african american family as the prepared for hurricane katrina and also the aftermath
False	I will have to look for that one, I lived in Louisiana shortly after Katrina and would love to read anything related to that subject.
False	I'm also very interesting in american politics. particularly pertaining to the upcoming presidential election 
False	Hunt, mostly dove and turkey. Do you hunt?
False	Never, guns are banned in our country. Have you had any luck so far?
False	Got a few dove this season, It didnt really get cold enough for them to come south this year. 
False	That's an interesting fact I never heard about, how do doves even taste like?
False	Like dark meat chicken. They are good wrapped in bacon and grilled 
False	That sounds delicious, I am not even sure if they live in my part of the world
False	where are you from?
True	I am from Mongolia, what about you?
True	Im from Texas. 
False	That's a long way, is there any particular time to shoot doves, like early morning or is any time good?
False	They are so great I love to see them compete and the food be looking so good. 
False	I wish I could cook like that. They put me to shame.
False	Lol cooking isn't my lingo either so don't feel bad. I'm a singer so the only cooking I'm doing is on stage.
False	Well, that's another skill I don't have. Although I will say, my cooking is far better than my singing.

False	I love reading also mostly spiritual and self care books what kind do you prefer to read? 
True	High Fantasy. Wheel of Time, Dune, books like that.
False	It's music theory. I love the product but the whole theory thing is a struggle for me.
False	Is that a hard class? what is the idea of the class?
False	It's not so much difficult as it is tedious. It's basically the rules of music. It's a lot of term memorization and whatnot.
False	Oh wow ive never heard of the class but it sounds interesting. I love music but never had a in dept look into it
False	It is very interesting. I think I would find it more interesting if it wasn't such an early class! What are you up to tomrrow?
False	I will be volunteering tomorrow at the locl soup shop for the homeless
False	Wow! Look at you! That's wonderful. Doing it with anyone or just going it alone?
True	Im going alone but have made many friends there. Do you volunteer?
True	I used to but I haven't had the time in a while. Do y'all need the help?
False	We can always use extra help there. If you ever have free time you should stop by
False	why not?
False	depending on their age - you have to monitor what they watch - some are just so inappropriate
False	Yes, you are right. I prefer Youtube, I get to restrict the inappropriate content 
False	yes - easier to control
False	also it is full of cats videos!
False	I don't watch cat videos - but like the practical jokes ones

False	Oh man, free food! That's pretty hard to say no to.
True	I like pizza! What is your favorite?

False	 I have always heard the same thing too! I think that may be something we hear South Lol. It may be true
False	Old wives tales maybe from the South.  LOL
False	Probably, fast food is just bad for you in general.
False	Yes that's true. You probably want to check out this organic diner across town. I heard that Kid Rock was last seen there. He is a delight.
False	Are they expensive?
True	No that expensive. It's slightly more than your usual chain restaurants but it's worth it. Are you tight on budget?
True	Yeah, I know the best way to save money is to buy groceries, but Im not a great cook.
True	Ah, well don't worry. Everyone starts somewhere. You can learn from online tutorials. This purple diner channel is a great start.

True	Awesome. I love sea food too! 
True	shrimp and pasta is good...seafood with italian...:)
True	Shrimp is the best. Especially with italian.
True	That's interesting. In my school district, 14-year-olds would be in high school. I do like the idea of having a broader mixture of ages, though.
True	I remember school details here cause it was when I got my start playing football. I play now for the Philadelphia Eagles, my second season.
True	Woah. Really? I grew up outside Philadelphia, in Cherry Hill, so you guys are still my home team!
True	Wow, small world! Yeah, last season I did not get a whole lot of playing time but now it's getting better.
False	Have you been with the team long? Where did you play college ball?
True	I went to college at Wake Forest. I'm excited to finally be getting more playing time and starting my career!
False	So what's it like playing on a professional team? 
True	It has its ups and downs like most things, but it's really rewarding to connect with fans and having them recognize you wherever you go.
False	Do you think about what you'd like to do later in life, after you're done playing? Would you like to get into coaching or something else?
False	As of now I can't see myself coaching. Would love to save up, start a family, and just travel the world with them. See lots of countries while we're young.
True	It's amazing how much talent is in the world! I can't believe how young some of them are!
False	yes , definitely very talented . what else do you enjoy ?
True	I enjoy garderning. I have a few rose bushes. They are a pain to take care of but so beautiful.

True	thanks , i spend my time working as an art teacher what about you ?
True	I mentioned it before, I am an art teacher as well. Although, I have been feeling sad lately.

True	Oh, big babies.  Do you have one?  I can't imagine not having a dog, even though mine gets under my feet while I'm cooking.
True	I don't have a dog currently
False	Wouldn't your kids like one?  I know mine enjoy ours.
True	I don't have kids. I ve always wanted to travel to puerto rico.
False	Now's a good time to travel -- no kids, no pets.

False	That is awesome!  what else do you do to stay healthy?
True	I love running, I just run a Marathon. 
False	I think so, Iâ€™m not sure.
True	I was very close to my janitor in elementary school.  He was always very nice to me.
True	I wasnâ€™t, they never really talked much if Iâ€™m being honest
True	I didn't really get along with my classmates much, so he was a friendly man and kept the bad kids away from me.
False	Thatâ€™s pretty nice of him.
False	It was. He's always had my back.
False	You really need a friend in school. Could only image what kids these days go through
False	I think there is such polarization in the climate.  Some kids, especially special needs kids, are really just targets.
False	Yea, to make others feel powerful. Which is really unfair
False	Indeed, that's true.  I just worry what long-term effects it will have on some of them.  It's hard to concentrate on school when your mind is hurting.
False	Interesting. That's very helpful. Have you ever shopped at goodwill?
True	Of course yes!. I like them because  they are  retail establishments run by a charitable organization to raise money.
False	Yea. It's extremely affordable and you find so many neat items.

False	Yes, that really helps but not everyone takes it as serious as us. If i couldi would just carry the items to my car everytime lol.
True	6th graders can be a bit challenging. I have been teaching for 12 years and I am ready for a change. 
False	Wow! Twelve years of teaching ANY age group would be challenging! 
True	I may try something more creative. I go to karaoke every Friday night and that is always the best part of my week. 
False	I didn't know you could sing! That's great! What kind of music do you like? 
True	I enjoy listening to dance type music, but I mostly sing 90's female alternative. What music are you into?
True	 I love so many types that it's hard for me to chose one. I guess it depends on the mood I am in. 
True	Yea, that's true for me too, but I don't have much of a taste for country music. What are you doing next Friday?
False	Country can be a bit much! I have to work. Maybe I should find a new job!
False	Ew, well if you get off early enough, maybe you can meet me at karaoke? If not this Friday, maybe another.
False	Thanks! And keep me posted on your job search.  I know that can be tough.

False	I'm in medical school as well so I know how long the hours can be.

False	"Basically. Anything to help kids and their diseases. I feel as if that's my ""calling""."
True	Was there anything that made you want to become a pediatrician?
True	Well, I love kids and I was inspired by my own pediatrician as a kid. He was my role model growing up.
True	That is really cool.  how many years of school have you went through so far?
False	Only one thus far so I have a long road ahead of me to say the least. lol I'm at the University of Cincinnati.
False	aaaah, but it will all be worth it in the long run!
True	So true! But if all else fails, I do enjoy theater work as well so theater is always an option. Ha!
False	Were you forced to go into medical school?  It seems you really want to go into theater
True	That's interesting? Do you own a civic coupe?
False	No, I had to buy a much smaller car. I have a Spark.
True	I'm not familiar with that car. Do you like it?
False	Yes, I do like my Spark. It is super small, but fits in small parking spaces.
False	Cool! I like Honda cars. 
True	Do you drive a Honda?
False	Yes, I do! A Honda Civic. 
True	Cool, do you like older cars?
False	I do! My best friend collects vintage cars. 
False	Awesome. We have 2 old cars.
False	We have a few professionals, but most of us are amateurs with growing experience in theater.
True	Thats awesome, what kind of performance do you do?
False	Sometimes works by noted playwrights, but sometimes a historian in the community will bring a manuscript based on local events.
True	Oh that must be interesting, brining to life the history of your community. How long have you been doing it?
False	I just started with them a couple years ago.  School is so intense, it gave me a great outlet when I'm on break. 
False	Yeah, sounds like a good creative outlet. I don't think I would do well on stage, I'm fine in front of a camera. 
False	I find I have to concentrate on my lines so hard, I forget about the audience.
True	That's probably quite useful. I make videos and spend most of my time editing, I can make up one good read of a line from loads of takes.
True	That would be fascinating!  Do you have particular subjects for your videos?
False	It's a mix of general vlogs and tutorials, it's gaining some subscribers which is exciting.
False	wow, that's interesting.  I follow a vlog by a Swedish lady that moved back to her tiny village to create a life for herself.
False	I love that kind of thing, a window into a world you know nothing about.
False	We read the Bible. There is a lot of good information there.
True	Have you read Fantastic Mr. Fox? Such a great kids book. Really anything by Roald Dahl
True	I have not read it. What age group is it aimed at?
False	I would say 5-10. There's also a movie so that could be fun for the kids to know the story first and then see the movie as a fun activity
False	I may have to get it and read to the grandkids. IF I can find time as I am trying to get a law degree.
False	Well I'm sure you are doing plenty of reading on your own already. Maybe get them an audio book to put them to sleep XD
False	I prefer to read to and with them. NOTHNG is more important than people.
False	That's very good. I'd like to see more parents interacting with their children instead of plopping a phone in front of them
False	It is very disturbing the way all of society clings to their phones. I enjoy playing tennis to get away.
True	I've never tried tennis, but it looks fun. I enjoy running. 
True	Not really. I mostly work the farm and spend time with my wife and children.
False	That sounds like a nice balance. Do you enjoy your own work?
True	I love it. I live a simple life. What do you do for work
True	I work from home for a Poultry company. I do IT work, I enjoy it 
False	Working from home is great. 
True	it really is , i get to do what i love
False	What is your ultimate life goal?
True	"My husband's family owns a farm. We want to eventually ""retire"" to take over for that. We're both in tech so I have a lot innovation ideas for the farm"
True	What a beautiful idea. More and more people are moving that way. My husband and I have similar plans.
True	I agree, I love farms because it feels so natural.
False	Oh, thats interesting. Whats your favorite genre of books?
True	I enjoy mostly science fiction books.
True	Really?! I love Sci-fi and Paranormal!
True	 and paranormal , those are usually good books to get into .
False	Who's your favorite?
True	stephen king probably
True	I love Robert McCammon.  
True	I loved his song Starfish & Coffee when I was little.
False	Cool. What Stephen King Movie adaptation do you like best? 
True	the original IT, dreamcatcher and the mist were really good
False	I grew up on a huge farm most of my childhood years and we focused on cotton and corn mostly.
True	I was in college before I learned that the corn you see when you drive through country areas is mostly for animal feed! I always thought it was normal corn
True	That's right, and the crows and some other animals really think it's for them lol. As busy as farm life was, I always loved reading and found time for it.

True	I got red flames across both arms. The color contrasts well with my curly red hair.
True	You're lucky. I love red hair. I'm blonde and used to dye my hair red, but it never looked natural. My skin coloring or something was off.
True	Actually I think contrast wasn't the right word. It's better to say that it complements my red hair!
False	I think contrasting and complementary colors might be the same? Like purple/yellow and red/green are complementary colors, but they are pretty contrast-y.
True	That might be true. Unfortunately I don't think I know much about the subject.
True	Oh, I don't either. Doesn't stop me from speculating, though! What's your jam? What do you know a lot about?
True	Music. I could tell you everything there is to know about any genre.

False	And cheaper! Get some sun, pat some dogs, see nature. What more could you want?
False	haha definitely . only invention i need is more time in the day to paint
True	I love a good glass of wine every once in a while, so long as I am not with my kids or at my shop

True	yes and it has  (at one point) the longest drop of 75m. I also like any water ride. 
True	Water rides are pretty cool most of them don't have as steep of drops so they tend to be easier on me.
True	I get a headache on most roller coasters because of the banging around. 
False	yeah they can definitely be strenuous. I would much rather be at home playing video games
True	I love the sights and sounds of an amusement park, and the food. 
True	Me too. I'm not really a big fan of rides but the food is the best part!
True	No it just hurts and can't get in the dentist for some time.

False	Ah, I see! that makes sense. Which do you like more, the switch or the ps4?
True	Thatâ€™s a tough one. I like my switch for overnight travel. But the ps4 beats when it comes to serious gaming. How about you?
True	That makes sense, I personally love the switch because of all of the nintendo exclusives.
True	True,  but the core gaming is important to me. Iâ€™m a CoD fan

False	I would say the only not so fun area would be The Glades. I love the outdoors also.
False	The glades is beautiful to look at but I wouldn't like to hang around there because of the gators.
False	I certainly would not want to try to introduce myself to the gators.
False	They are scary animals that shouldn't be messed with.

False	Free books is a great perk. Is he your only child?
True	No, I have 3. Sadly for me the oldest is in eternity.
True	yes, my situation has improved, i have learned to enjoy being alone now and spend a lot of my time hiking.
False	Hiking is a wonderful hobby. Have you ever considered doing it in a group?
True	I have hiked in groups before but I think i prefer doing it by myself. It eliminates distractions and allows me to be fully submerged in nature. Do you hike?
False	not often, maybe i should more
False	I would recommend it. What do you do as a hobby?
True	i play badminton. im in a rec league but we take it pretty seriously
False	oh wow. that is neat. do you play singles or doubles?

True	a long time. i messed around with it as a kid but i got more serious in college
True	I work at a hospital. I am a doctor!

False	wow! purple grapes and purple scrubs.  i bet you get lots of smiles :)
True	I've heard of it.. I actually was held hostage once during a store robbery.
True	Oh wow, I am glad you are okay. Nothing you can do to avoid it in public but I have a dog for home protection.
False	I don't have a dog right now.. but we had one growing up.. my dad wasn't home much as he was a cop at the time.
False	I am always home baking and cooking. I would worry about a family member having such a dangerous job.
False	Well he's retired now.. so fortunately it worked out ok for him :)  I love to cook, but I'm not a very good baker :)
False	Aww good, I bet he enjoys retirement. That move Hostage showed how important a cops job is.
False	Yeah it did.. it was actually fairly accurate, too.  Law Enforcement, in general, go through a LOT of turmoil in their lives.
False	I have to most respect for them because they have to deal with extreme mental stress. 
False	Absolutely.. not a lot of jobs out there where you are literally unsure if you're going to be returning home alive at the end of the day.
False	That would definitely be a job I would not want, but we need heroes to stop bad people like in Hostle. 
True	No I just let it dry, It was only water to it wasnt smelly or anything
True	Thank goodness!  I sat on chocolate once when I was in middle school and I was wearing white!
False	Oh no, that just cant dry out
False	No not at all.  I had to wear my sweatshirt around my waist all day so that saved me hahaha!
False	Thats good though. Im sure not very many people even noticed
False	Not too many.  Only a few friends but we had a good laugh!
False	Haha childhood memories are always fun to look back o0n
False	Yes, especially the ones where you wanted to crawl in hole.  Where did you grow up?
False	I grew up in Alabama
False	Not too far from me.  I am from Georgia. 
True	He is just crazy! I think someone dared him.
True	Interesting.. Did he get in trouble? Was this at a high school or something? And does he take gymnastics?! Back flips are hard!
False	It was at work at a family business. He probably will not be in trouble.
False	Oh, I thought it was at school.  How old was he?
False	I'm sorry, yes at school. Thanks for correcting me. He is 17. He should know better.
False	Yah, it's a wonder he wasn't hurt, or someone else hurt.  He should be a cheerleader!
False	I agree. There should be more male cheerleaders.
False	Where I went to school, we had a separate squad, of just male cheerleaders.  They used to do backflips every time the team scored.
False	That sounds great. A combined squad would be fantastic also.
False	Especially in the locker room!  LOL!
True	Still figuring it out a little since I'm just eighteen and fresh out of high school with honors! Anything outdoors I love though. You?
True	I enjoy outdoors a lot!

True	Thanks! I'm getting over it. I wish I've been to more places! Specially to a city
True	You have to stay strong I get teased all the time about my occupation as a short order cook at a local diner.
False	Yeah! Everyone has their own story! What's there to tease about what you're doing!
True	I guess I am not making as much as my other friends or associates
False	I'm the same!
True	It's ok I learn to destress from it all. Like this past summer i hiked the appalachian trail it was amazing.
False	Oh cool! How long was it? Did you go by yourself?
True	It took me a while to do so but I went about 3 years ago and I would love to go back. 
True	That sounds like a great idea for me. Specially here in Ohio, you can find many natural trails
False	That is amazing. What do you do for fun?
False	It is! After trying for so long, I finally feel happy.
True	I got divorced two years ago but I am very happy!
False	Why did you get divorced? What about the relationship made you unhappy?
True	It just didn't work out, nothing bad though! I got my cat out of the deal and that's what matters most!

True	I'm a forward like Abby Wambach.
True	Very nice! I played some forward and goalie!
False	That is great.  How many years did you play?
True	I played for eight years, it was so much fun!
True	It is very fun.  I played for six years!
True	It depends on the cases! I work with not very fun cases
False	you have to be really logical to be able to apply the legal theories

False	You need some prayers right now.  Just know that he is being well taken care of.
False	Thank you so much! You're very kind.
True	Oh thanks.  I appreciate that!  I have lost both parents so I know how nervous you must be.
False	Oh, I am so sorry for your loss.
True	Thank you!  It's been over 10 years.  But that type of feeling stays with you.
True	I am very lucky not to have lost anyone that close to me but I imagine it does. 
False	Of course they say time heals all wounds.  We just have to have faith and move on.
False	Yes you're right, I believe that time is the best way to heal.

True	"I was always told that the reward for a ""good deed"" can actually be found in the deed itself.  You sound like a very responsible individual.  "
False	That is very nice of you to say, so since you don't work do you take a lot of cool vacations?

False	Yeah, definitely. I'm always looking for ways to make more money.
True	Most of us have to these days, especially with the way the economy's been for years.

True	A mix of both. I usually do half and half. Although certain veggies grow better in pots
True	Well, i live in the midwest and it gets really cold out here. Do you recommend any plants that can grow in harsh weather?

True	That goes over my head. I don't know enough to speak on it.
True	What's it like to not almost die from eating apples?
True	I don't really like them much anyway. My mom does though, so I keep them in the house.
False	I, too, like your mom

False	I can only imagine. How old is your Mom?

False	Oh boy - that sounds like quite the memory! Why did you get sick?
False	Well, we stopped for lunch at this roadside place, it was really busy, figured it was safe.  It's why I can't stand the sight of tacos to this day.

False	So, do you see your parents often?
True	Yes, I am lucky to see them every couple weeks or so

False	you are so right there i suppose
False	It makes me want to be more approachable so I can inform people on the horrors other countries have to endure.

False	It truly is bizarre.
False	Did you end up getting hurt in the fight and suing him?

True	I found my husband after that garbage happened.
True	That's great news!  Where did you meet your husband?  I met mine while stationed in Hawaii.  We are both serving in the military. 
True	I met him in a business meeting. I run my own consulting firm.
False	What do you consult on?  That must be exciting to run your own firm!
True	I work in marketing. What branch of the military are you in?
True	My favorite color is blue, so I joined the Air Force.  Plus, men in jumpsuits are just hot! Ha Ha
True	Yes, They really are! I play football too
True	That's cool! I am terrible at sports but I admire people who are good that them.
True	I've been playing it since high school. Now I play in college

True	Oh I do like yellow too but red is my all time favorite.
False	Yellow just seems to brighten up things for me, and puts off happy vibes.
False	Yes, I agree it does brighten up things. 
False	What other foods do you like?  
True	Oh, I like all foods, just vegetables most of all.  I do love Cheetos, though.  
True	Cheetos are good!  I'm not a big fan of vegetables.  If I had to choose, I would say green beans are my favorite.  
True	I like green beans, too.  Especially when they're just picked.  How do you like to cook them?
True	I like them best baked or using the air fryer.  Have you every used an air fryer? 
False	No, but I'm interested in them.  Are they really healthier than deep frying?
False	I think the food tastes just as good if not better.  They have to be healthier, since no oil is used.  
False	That makes sense =)  I want to eat healthy, but do indulge in fried food sometimes - this could help that.
False	Yes it could.  I love using mine.  I have cooked many meals in it.  Pork chops are my favorite in the air fryer.  
False	Oh wow, that sounds SO good.  I wonder if I could make fries out of carrots in it...?  Dip 'em in ranch ;)

True	I really like cake, not a fan of veg though
True	I love cheesecake what is your favorite cake?
False	I didn't do any specific program, I just paid a little extra on my membership to get a personal trainer!
True	Nice, what made you decide to get a trainer as opposed to finding a program yourself?
True	Having a trainer made me stay consistent and kept pushing me even when I wanted to quit.
True	That makes sense. Do you have any pets?
True	I have a dog. I want to get another so he's not so lonely. Do you have pets?
True	Yes, I'm a big fan of lizards so I own a few of those. What kind of dog do you own?
True	I have a German Shepherd, he's still a puppy. I got him for my girlfriend a few months ago, but she tells me she doesn't want him anymore.
True	That's too bad, I've always loved german shepherds, they're very smart.
True	He's already so smart! She tells me she's leaving me. I'd choose my dog and guitar over her any day!
True	Haha, I hear that. I'm big into my guitar as well, I've always been the guy with long hair and a rebellious rock attitude.

True	no . do you speak other languages ?

False	Lets take the topic away from politics for now. What are your thoughts on video games? Particularly RPGs?
False	They're a good way to escape from reality! Do you have a favorite?
True	Its so hard to pick a favorite. A good one I recently got into is called The Outer Worlds. It's similar to older Fallout games.
True	I don't play them much myself, but I like to watch YouTubers play the games.
True	Ah, I do that whenever I cant afford to buy a game. I just love the immersive storytelling the games can provide
True	I like watching the gameplays so I can watch it like a movie. My favorite is The Last of Us.
False	The Last of Us is TOTALLY like a movie! The emotion that the characters convey is so well done.

True	lol, me too - my brothers actually picked him out, but he's become fonder of me over time (it's the treats, lol)
True	My mother is a makeup artist and has a dog herself. I think she would put make up on the dog if that were less weird lol
True	Bahahaha, I've seen pictures of dogs with makeup on online - tell me these aren't your mom!?
False	Not that I know of unless she has posted them secretly! Im waiting for her to come out with a business one day haha
True	I am currently a student, I am going to be a vet.

True	Me too! LOL! I have a pet dog, and she inspires me everyday. I can't wait to work with all types of animals. Do you have a pet?
True	Yes, I have a dog.  He's a rescue and the best dog ever, in my opinion. LOL  
True	I totally agree with having a rescue dog, or pet, they deserve loving homes. I personally not attracted to pure bred dogs, to many potentials for birth defects.
True	Yes, I agree.  I hear that a lot.  It seems like they know they were rescued and are now very much loved.
False	I really think rescued animals, actually rescue us more. 
False	Yes, I absolutely agree.  
False	How many hours do you work a week at the clinic?
True	I am at the clinic 40-50 hours.  It's not too bad though, most people are nice.  I get to do all the talking.  LOL
False	no, by the time i bought it there was not that sale
False	that is too bad.
False	i know!!
True	I need my laptop for my job as a professional translator, so I understand.
False	well is the moment to buy one, the prices are good now
False	That is good to know, I will have to look. 
False	do not miss the opportunity
False	What laptop brand did you get?
False	i got a mac 
False	Oh fancy! those do not usually go on sale often, its surprising to hear it did.
False	How many kids do you have?
True	2- but that is a lot, trust me.
False	I wouldn't know, I don't have any kids.  Do you have time for yourself with 2 kids?
True	Not really. I used to follow my favorite band's tour, but not anymore. :(
True	That's too bad.  I would love to be a band's fashion coordinator.  It would be right up my alley.
False	That sounds like fun! I always assumed bands just put on whatever clothes they felt like.
False	That's what they want you to think, but the biggest bands have their outfit coordination down to a science.
False	Hmm ,never really thought about it that way. Why do you think that is?
False	I think it's just all about image and what they try to portray.  Are you influenced by the way band's look, or just their music?
True	Their look doesn't matter much to me- I'm all about the music!
False	It was a huge mess. But I love her and forgive her when she misbehaves.
False	Animals are wonderful.  Most of the time.

False	Nice.  What do you do for a living?
False	I paint houses. What do you do?
False	Real estate.
False	I'm not entirely sure.
False	I'm not the least bit surprised, since she was considered a bit of an eccentric by her neighbors.
False	Anyone who is a hermit or recluse would be considered eccentric. A lot of creative people are as well
False	That's true. Anyone who marches to the beat of their own drum is often shunned.
False	When they should be welcomed and celebrated. Just because someone else's version of happy doesn't match our own doesn't make theirs wrong
False	That's totally right! In hindsight I'm sure people would have gotten to know her
False	I'm not so sure. Some things have progressed while others have not in my opinion
False	That is fair, I should have specified. Some people would have retrospectively been able to appreciate her work, had they known. She still wouldn't have appealed to everyone.
False	Hindsight is always 20/20
False	Indeed. Oh well at least we can appreciate her work now!
False	Our main bucket list item is to see the Northern Lights and after that, perhaps the Maldives. And retire somewhere in the mountains so we see snow every year.
False	Wow, that sounds awesome. Typically people want to get away from the cold in retirement, and here you are chasing it down.
True	One of us is originally from the Philippines and the other from the Deep South in USA, so we are both tired of the hot and humid weather lol
False	Haha, makes sense. I play jazz piano in a band, I may need to add the Maldives as a potential tour stop and see what the hype is about!
False	It's a beautiful island nation for sure. Jazz would sound great there! I love taking walks and listening to jazz actually.
False	That's awesome, it definitely soothes the soul! Would you say that it's your favorite genre?
True	For relaxing it would be my favorite genre of music. Although what I listen to most in general is classic rock.
False	Very cool. You mentioned one of you are from the Philippines, are you still able to speak the native tongue? 
False	Definitely, especially from my region of the Philippines. What's challenging is understanding Alabamian accents here, hehe.
False	Oh, I bet. French and Arabic are my second and third languages, and I can understand those better than accents in the deep south haha.
False	Teaching at a pretty large school
False	How long have you been  a teacher
True	Not too long been teaching for 8 years but only 2 at my current school!
False	Wow, that's great. Teachers are a blessing
False	Thank You, what do you do for work?
False	I work at a vets office
False	Oh thats great! I can't imagine diagnosing something that can't tell you whats wrong.
False	Yes it's rough but im just the assistant. i have gotten 2 snakes from people who would drop animals off and never come back
False	Thats so sad! But I guess they are better in your care then their previous owners.
False	Yeah, a lot of people just dont understand the care animals need
False	It will be expensive to treat as I only work part time right now at an aldi store.
False	I am sure she will be okay
False	Hopefully, I'm trying to take my daughter mind of off it. We are watching our favorite movie together, Titanic.

False	What type of work do you do?
True	I sell exotic pets
False	Do you make a lot of money doing this ?
False	i get by on it pretty well. It's a good way to provide for my 4 kids
False	That is great children are expensive 
False	they really are. 
False	They are always needing something .
False	Six Flaggs Fiesta Texas is such a blast!  It's a can't miss!

False	They have the very best rollercoasters!  We ride those over and over.  This weekend is going to be Fright Fest which makes it extra fun!
True	I live in the DFW area so my oldest wants to go this weekend. My youngest son is blind though so I will need to find a sitter 
False	That will be nice.  The Dallas park is fun too.  I'm sorry your youngest can't go.
False	It will be okay. My oldest gets upset that there are things like this that we can't always do but he gets it. He's a good brother
False	Aww two brothers, that's sweet.  Sounds like they're close.
False	They are! How is the weather supposed to be this weekend? It's cold and raining here currently.

False	Oh that's too bad. Does sunscreen help at all?
False	A little,but I still burn pretty bad. I do love going to the zoo to see the zebras
False	Me too! Tigers are my favorite animal. 
True	I have my car interior as zebra stripe, how odd is that for a older woman?
True	My glasses are held together with tiger stripe duct tape. So, not odd at all!
False	I would pay to see that, I bet you get a lot of compliments?
True	I think people who know me would say that it's fitting of my personality
True	Because I'm in the garden. My Favorite thing to do
False	Thats sounds like a good plan.How big is your garden
True	Its a small garden on my patio. I like to sit out there and drink my coffee
False	Sounds like a great way to relax eeh

True	Ballet is so beautiful and graceful. I'm sure it takes a great amount of discipline to learn to dance, especially ballet.
True	i agree, i also do yoga to keep my body limber and mind focused on dance night
True	I have tried yoga once or twice. It was okay. I should probably try it again sometime. My favorite exercise is riding my bicycle.
False	You should definitely try. You'll get addicted!
True	I have a friend that says it really relaxes her. There are a lot of health benefits for sure.
True	it does help a great deal. you just need to find a pace and all that is good for you
True	I am not a huge movie buff. I watch a lot of stand up comedy though.
False	Oh me too! I'm actually going to a show on friday.
False	What show?
False	Dusty Slay
False	I will have to check them out
False	He's been on Jimmy Kimmel a lot. 
False	I'll look him up. Have you heard of Iliza Sherslinger?
True	Yeah! I saw her in Nashville.
False	So lucky! I would love to see her live! 
False	Maybe next tour
True	Pretty bummed out.  She was my mom's sister and best friend.
False	i'm sorry to hear that . when did she pass ?
True	4 days ago.  She was visiting from the states too when she passed.

True	Yeah, how about you?  Are your parents still alive?
True	they are . are your parents still living ?
True	My mom is, but my dad passed away 10 years ago.
True	I hear that memory isn't very accurate sometimes... maybe it wasn't as bad as I remember? Your dad is a nice guy.
True	No, but I also didn't learn Spanish!
True	I did the same thing. It's too hard to learn at an older age. Especially when it's a mandatory school thing instead of an actual thing you WANT to learn.
False	And most highschool language teachers are utter garbage. The pace isn't fast enough and there's not enough immersion.
True	True, although I don't know about it not being fast enough. I think in my case it was too fast. Going from 'hola' to complex sentences in like two days
False	"Yeah, there's a balance to be sure. They also have you learn dumb things, like ""where is the library"" instead of basic conversation, like ""I'm hungry"""
True	True. Not sure who exactly would be looking for a library in another language. Maybe if it's like a famous landmark in Spain or something, but otherwise it's useless
True	There are a lot of great tools for learning languages now. Apps and such
False	For sure. I don't know that I'll ever get around to actually ever using one. Might need some incentive, like a spouse who speaks it
True	What language would you like to learn?
True	Probably Spanish would be the most useful since it's the second most common here. Otherwise, French would be cool because it's more rare and romantic. Hah
False	That sounds exciting! Ever cover any cool stories?

True	My two cousins are plumbers. I almost became a plumber. How do you like it?
True	It's pretty fun. The pay isn't great, but it keeps me busy. Decent work for now.

True	I never remember my dreams. It's been years.

True	That sounds awesome! I've only ever been to Florida in order to get to Disney World. Are you there to visit family? Business? To sight-see?
True	Well, I make it a two-for, I see the family and do the Disney thing. Then I help my Mom at the Shelter she volunteers at.
False	Thats really sweet of you to help her out.  What type volunteer work do you help with?
True	Working at the Kitchen, she's inspired me to buy extra at home on sale, and to donate the overstock locally. After the kitchen though...beach time!

True	i am not familiar with that what is it about?
False	It is about the people's struggle with never ending war, constant government surveillance, and public manipulation.

False	"Seems nice to just jump and just travel with a ""figure things as you go"" type deal."
True	Interesting, do you have a favorite composer?
True	I love lots of classical music artists of course, but my favorite has to be none other than Beethoven!
True	Can't go wrong with that. Some of my fondest memories were traveling with my dad and grandpa in the circus and them introducing me to Beethoven.
True	We have that in common then. I can't say the same for my wife and three kids. They get tired of hearing me play classical lol.
True	Haha, I only live with my two golden retrievers, so they don't have much say in the matter.
True	Ah, I love dogs. Used to have a golden retriever. Now we have a miniature dachshund. If they howl at the music, they like it!
True	"Haha, if that's the case then I guess a dogs favorite genre is ""emergency vehicle sirens"""
False	lol, maybe so. My dog seems to love the sound of a loud nearby train on that note.
False	I'm pretty fond of trains myself, I traveled on them with my family circus growing up.
False	I've only traveled by train once for an hour. My family wants to take a train vacation that goes across several states one day.
False	That's very noble of you. Animals deserve respect too.
True	I would like to give respect to animals too. Do you have any activist beliefs?
False	Yes, I believe in protecting the environment. We use too many wasteful products that include plastic.
True	And that plastic is also bad for our health too
True	That is very true. I read that scientists have developed a bacteria that eats plastic. Maybe it will help us clean up the oceans.
False	That would be really cool. It would be the least we could do to clean up our mess
False	It makes me very happy that you care for the environment as well. I feel that it is an important issue.

False	That's going top be a tough conversation. I can't imagine having that talk with my wife. I hope it goes okay.
False	So for now I just need to collect my thoughts.

True	If that happened to me, my wife would take away my vehicle. Are you married?
True	No I am not , glad I am not it would be a burden on the marriage 
True	I understand. I get lectures from my wife all the time. Honestly I'm not afraid of what she thinks. Sometimes fun is worth an angry wife.
False	I bet you get in trouble a lot with your wife lol
True	Lol. She wears the pants in the family. But she makes great spaghetti so I can tolerate her.
True	that s so cool . spaghetti is alright that is one great meal do you garlic bread with it ?
True	Garlic bread and meatballs. I have to have meatballs with my spaghetti. What is your favorite food?
True	I like hamburgers with everything on them  
True	It pays the bills, ya know? It's just a part time gig for me, my main source of income is working as an insurance salesman.
False	They bought Sears for $11 BILLION... can you imagine?  
False	That's definitely insane, wouldn't have assumed it's value was anywhere near that.
False	Me either especially considering my pay for selling washers there ! lol
True	Haha, how do you like to de-stress after a long day of selling washers?

False	Just for myself. I'm not good enough to sing publicly.

False	Have you considered sending him to timeout? That would be a way to punish him without being violent with him
True	He's a bit too old for timout. Grounding him doesn't really seem to work either
True	How old is he?
False	He's 14 and his sister is 12. They've really been jerks to each other lately
False	I'm sorry you're having such a hard time with them. Beating up a sibling is a serious issue. You should find a way to punish him somehow.
False	Do you have kids? I'm just not used to this kind of conflict. I was never like this with my sister growing up so I'm not sure what to do
True	I don't have kids. I've only got two cats. They fight, but I'm not sure that dealing with conflict among pets qualifies me to offer parenting advice. 
False	Yes, no doubt one of the best in our history 
False	I would love to play in a band someday!

False	Yeah I visit movie theaters sometimes when a movie takes my fancy
False	I enjoy going to the movies.  It's a lot easier than TV as I can only see 200 feet away.

False	One time it took 3 months for my left hand to turn loose of the steering wheel. Had to remove it so I could pee.

False	it sounds like such an exciting place to be ,maybe i will go in the new year
False	What sport do you play?
True	I play football. My parents got me into it at a young age, but frankly I wish I could be more serious about other subjects in school
False	Well, at least your love for football got you a scholarship! That's more than a lot of people can say.
False	Very true. Too many people are not fortunate enough to acquire funding for their education/career paths
False	Exactly. College is super expensive, so any funding you can get is a blessing.
False	Yes, university has gotten so expenssive. A medical school education now costs over a hundred thousand dollars.
False	That's more than a lot of entry level medical professionals can hope to make it a year! 
False	Indeed. If the post-secondary education system could be cheaper, a lot more people would have access to their life goals
False	Very true. And a lot of people are entering college without really knowing what they want to do, thus wasting money.
False	Thats a huge issue as well. Too many people come out of high school with no practical knowledge or any idea of what they want in life

True	Being a couch potato, watching a movie, lounging and enjoying a glass of wine.

True	Scallops are probably my favorite. Or maybe king crab

True	I guess it's similar but 1 king crab leg would be equivalent to like 50 crawfish
False	Yum! I think i will have to look into giving those a try
True	You definitely should. They're expensive so I don't eat it often
True	Most seafood is costly. I usually eat at my local mall food court during a shopping break and they have so much to choose from
False	Ouch. Wow. I suppose that is true though
False	Yes, we need to start teaching about this from a young age in schools.
False	Yea, maybe they wont do it in the future
False	That's probably true, but who knows in this country.
False	Honestly, history seems to repeat itself here anyway
False	i agree . another thing we can do to fix the world we live in .
False	Yea, kids are the future I guesss
False	i guess you are right 
False	right? and here we are!! tomorrow flying cars...I hope so and I'd love to work on them! I hate my job...
False	Do you think self-driving cars would help?  Those would be fun to work on also!
False	Well, not so sure about that, after that crazy crash with Tesla. But, i'd love to explore alternate transportation options...Beam me up!
False	Indeed, Elon Musk is a genius though, Hes made the Tesla Powerwall, Powerpack batteries, solar panels and solar roof tiles for people all over the world.
False	Agree totally...and we need to be collectively and seriously exploring all options away from fossil fuel without a doubt.
False	What do you think about solar? I hope we can pave the planet with panels someday!
False	Solar is a great option, but also worry about the balance of nature vs technology. Its all about balance
False	I see, how do you think we can balance technology with our lives?
False	"Envision this, ""This used to be Yellowstone National Park, but now every living tree and plant has been removed to be a monstrous solar field""...ugh"

False	What is your favorite thing about the beach?
True	I love the sound of the waves crashing, the sunshine, and my feet in the sand.
False	Those are all my favorites too. I spend more time in the sand than the water..that's for sure.
False	The water can be chilly and you never know whats going to be in it either. Sometimes its pretty gross...
False	I agree. Sometimes I get the urge to body surf, but I'd rather lay on the beach and soak in the rays.
True	My dog enjoys the sand, I like to walk him on the beach. But he likes splashing around in the water alot 
True	That's so fun though! I should really get a dog to come on those kind of adventures with me.
False	You definitely should! Its so much fun having a buddy to travel around with you. 
True	it sure is. It all happens so fast! my kid is already talking in her sleep and enjoys folk metal just like her dad!
False	That is awesome. Your kiddo will be talking your ear off in no time.
False	oh yeah, tell me about it. How long did you guys wait before having your kid?
True	We waited 3 years. 
False	That's a long time. Ours was a surprise. But hey, it happens. Does it get harder when they become teens? 
True	Jenny's been moodier in her teens, but she's a good kid. William will be 13 next year 
True	Two teens. yikes. Well it's good that they're close in age. I'm 10 years older than my sister. We aren't close
True	I really enjoyed growing up with a brother and sister that were close to my age. I was excited that my kids could have that same experience
False	We want the same for our daughter. Hopefully it will be easy to have another. we are getting older
False	are y'all trying for another baby yet?
False	That sounds to scary for me, I can't deal with serial killer stuff

False	Oh, nice! I've been wanting to build my own website, but I've been going through a hard time and it's taking all my energy.
True	I've been doing a lot of things for myself lately. I want to start investing money
False	Really, what is a good place to invest money?
False	I don't know. I just started to do some research
True	Well, I guess I have plenty of time to do my own research, now that I'm single. I wish you luck in your investments! 
True	I have two older half brothers, one younger half brother, and a younger half sister. 
True	I have three older siblings. Do you wish you were an only child?
True	Well I consider myself an only child actually, because I never lived with my siblings. I hated it to be honest. It was lonely.
True	Your parents should have gotten you a pet. I had a dog and it was wonderful.
True	Fortunately we almost always had a dog. That did help a lot for sure. I began working online as a side gig recently and my dog keeps me company.
True	That's great, what kind of side gig? I'm doing something similar right now.
True	I have two actually. One of them I go places, take pictures, and answer questions. I eat meat so it's good they have pizza mystery shopping.
False	That sounds fun. Does it pay well?

True	No I haven't I've heard great things about them though.
False	No, it is a dog.

False	I can understand that.  How old is your daughter?
True	18. She just graduated high school. So proud of her, she was at the top of her class. 
True	That's awesome.  When I graduated my parents sent me on a trip to backpack in the forests of California.
False	oh, that seems like fun! Why California? 
False	Because I had never been that far west.  Have you been to California?
True	No, I stay pretty close to home.

False	I've always believed hard work equals talent if you have the passion. It sounds like you have plenty of it. 
False	I believe in that too! Thanks, It's great to hear something like this.
True	I never thought I would be doing what I am. I certainly didn't know much about it. But through work and research I'm doing what I love.

True	I actually have a side gig where I go to various places taking pictures for a company and answer questions and they pay me. It's fun.

True	Well do you have any olympic size swimming pools there?
False	I... actually have no idea. If there is, I don't know where it is.
False	Well I hope he does a show near you. Have you heard of Wilm Hof?
True	I'm actually not legally married to my husband (though I call him that). We are common-law partners.  Doesn't bother me but I'm sure it would bug some people.
False	I haven't managed to find anyone yet, but I think as long as your in love, your legal status doesn't matter
False	Agreed.  For us, marriage just seemed like a waste of money--you can do a lot more exciting things with that amount!
True	Yes, you can! What do you guys like to do together?

False	I don't really have a favorite. How about you?
True	Probably Vince Vaughn. I like a lot of his movies

True	I keep it at a boatyard. I have my own boat too, it makes it possible to fish for snowcrab. 
True	That's nice! I've been wanting to start oystering, but I'm have a baby, for the second time around. I don't think a boat would be my friend.
False	Oh my word! Congratulations! I eat a lot of oysters, I love eating all sorts of seafood. 
True	Thank you, we're getting excited! I am a vegetarian who only eats oysters. That seems funny when I say it out loud!
False	Ha ha! People that only eat fish meat are called pescatarians. But does that include oysters? I am not sure. 
False	Lol, I'm not sure either! Labels can be confusing. I'm an artist so I just try to roll with it:)
True	Wow, what kind of artist are you? I love to paint fish and the sea but I am not so skilled. 
True	I am a photographer, my mentor is Sally Mann! Most of my pieces are on landscapes and people, the capturing of the soul. I love that you paint!
True	Oh, a photographer, I see. I am not familiar with Sally Mann unfortunately. I will look for her instagram. But yes, I love to finger paint, it relaxes me.
True	Yes, do look into her, you won't regret it. Wow! Finger painting, now that's a technique I haven't thought about for quite some time! So cool:)
True	I will have to try to remember my instagram password, haha! Yes, I love to finger paint, and do full body paintings, but it uses a lot of paint.
True	Totally, we have too many passwords to remember!! How much does it cost you to do a full body painting?
True	It absolutely is and I love watching Grey's Anatomy. How about you?
True	I do. Most would probably think I'm strange cause I know so much about the show, along with that I have orange and blue hair lol.
False	Lol that is funny. I can't live with out it honestly it's apart of my every day life. I live by a schedule to stay sane lol.
True	I would like to live more by a set schedule, but my 3-year-old makes that difficult lol
False	Lol I can really relate kids are adorable and they definitely keep you on your toes.
True	That they do. I'm enjoying my daughter and hoping to have one more child in the next couple of years. I dread their teenage years though.
False	I can say the teenage years are scary let me tell you
False	Oh I'm sure. They were scary enough for me when I was a teenager. Things are so different these days from 20 years ago!
False	Yes it is and it's so sad to say the least
False	That it is. We spent most of our time outdoors and now they all live in their phones moreso than anywhere else. Sigh. 
False	Ugh. I completely agree and just think Grey's Anatomy will be a thing of the past.
False	I dread the day when it is. Hopefully Netflix and other outlets like cable TV will keep it alive like they did some other shows like The Andy Griffith Show.
False	I do workout, I love wearing name brand like Nike to make me feel powerful
False	Nike is great for sure. I've been impressed with Adidas lately too
True	I was asked to play professionally with a womans basketball team, I was so excited
False	That's so cool. Do you still play?
True	These knees can not longer bend like they used too, I just mentor when I can
False	That's unfortunate. DO you follow the WNBA?
False	I do follow it, it has changed so much over the years, better for women now and more notoriety
False	I'm not the biggest basketball fan but I like watching some college and March Madness for sure
False	That sounds like an excuse to have a wing and nacho party in the mix while watching
False	And fill out tournament brackets...
True	No. I just love gospel music because I hear it a lot in church. my father was a preacher so I grew up with it
False	I am a musician, gospel music is great.

False	Do you have any favorite movies?
True	Yes i like superhero movies. What sort of movies do you like?
True	I enjoy drama movies. My favorite is last of the Mohicans
False	Oh yes, that is a good movie! 
False	What is your favorite movie?
True	I enjoyed the Marvel Universe movies, i liked the way they all join up. 
True	For sure. I'm not one to have many friends at once, so working in the museum is perfect for me. It's quiet and I meet a lot of people.
True	Yeah.  Lots of historical signifigance there.  Like DEaly plaza where JFK was killed.  Conspiracy nuts love it.
True	My favorites are natural history museums. I have a keen interest in animals and nature in general.
True	I like Green museums. The help people be more conscious of their world and it's limitations and how their actions affect it.
False	Those are nice too! You sound like you know your way around museums yourself.
True	yes a few . i like to visit museums for inspirations sometimes .
False	What are some of your other hobbies or interests?
True	I like visiting art museums. State and local art museums are similar but where they differ is the collection itself.
False	Ah yes, city museums, especially those in smaller cities or towns, are easily overlooked. Many hidden gems out there.
False	Yea they even have artifact galleries you can look at.
False	That sounds like it would make a cool little comic.
False	Yeah it would, since the chello is one of the least popular choices of instruments for children.
False	Wonder why they don't like it as much?
True	Well since my mother taught me, I really didn't have a choice. The kids at the Y tease me about it.
True	Oh I'm sorry to hear that. I also get picked on about reading comic books and wanting to be a super hero.
False	Which super hero do you aspire to be?
True	It has always been the character Vampirella.
True	That sounds interesting.Tomorrow I will have to share that at the Y. A mixture of vampires and Cinderella is an awesome topic for the pool.
False	Lol true! What sport do you participate in at the Y?
True	I participate in swimming every day. It takes an every day attempt to get me over my fear of drowning.
False	i know that you are going to take lots of pics. are you going with family?
False	Yes, with my brother. We like to take adventure trips together a couple of times a year when classes allow.
False	that is so cool! who is older?
False	I am 8 years older. I'm 18 years older than my sister. Mom liked to spread it out I guess. lol
True	that is really cool that you like to spend time with your family.  how long do you two plan to spend at winter the dolphin?
False	Just a day or 2. Then we are off to the Don Cesar in St.Petersburg. Have you ever heard of it?
False	no! i haven't sounds luxurious.  is it a five-star hotel?
False	Yes it is. It's really old and looks like a giant pink stucco castle, but it's fabulous inside. Great way to finish the trip.
True	sounds amazing! what type of architecture do you think they based it on?
True	I'm not sure, but it looks like it's old Spanish style architecture. Do you know a lot about architecture?
False	Singing in the shower is the best.
False	Shower beers are also the best
False	I've never had alcohol actually. Whats it like?
True	Depends how much you drink I guess!
False	what about enough to get, as they say, wasted?
True	Have a lot of fun and then pay for it the next day when you feel horrible
False	Sounds like a bad choice if you leave without someone.
False	Yea you should be safe about drinking for sure
False	I always hear that. 
False	I guess that applies to anything though
False	I was running late for work. 
False	Even if you're late it's still dangerous to do that, you should be careful! Have you ever been in a car crash?
True	Only once, but my brother was driving. Never as the driver!
True	They are very scary, I was hit by a driver who jumped a red light. Broke my legs and one arm. It was horrible
False	That sounds horrible. I hope you were able to recover completely and have no permanant issues. 
True	Sadly not, don't have full movement in one arm and I still walk with a limp as my leg never healed properly. Happy to be alive though!
False	Yes, better than the alternative. I see scary wrecks all the time and i cringe. I lost a good friend in a motorcycle accident.
False	I'm sorry to hear that. Do you ride motorcycles? I'm too scared
True	No I am too scared also. My brother had one for a while. I was so happy when he sold it.
False	I bet, my friend is a doctor, in th ER they call them donorcycles
False	Do you have any brothers or sisters?
True	I have two sisters! One older one younger.
True	I have 5 brothers and sisters. 4 brothers passed away and I have sister that is left
False	Thats sad. I guess even with them gone you still had them once
False	Do you go to church?
True	I use to go to church when I was little, not any more.
False	Why did you stop going?
True	It just didn't seem to help you know. Do you go?
True	 Barely.  I dont know if there is a God or not.
False	I guess going to church doesnt mean there is or isnt.
True	i love to read because it is easier to gain knowledge through literature since you can interpret the words how you want
True	I enjoy reading as well it takes me to a new world.
False	people also have a habit of allowing their biases to show through when speaking to one another. even teachers do it
True	Everyone should be allowed to think for themselves without all the outside influences.
False	i completely agree. having the information is vital but i think its more important to have objective, factual information first to form your own opinion
False	I definitely agree with you on that.
False	it's actually insane how people can teach children things and skew their entire world view.
False	Yes, that is very true people try and shape young minds to fit their beliefs.
False	i think that's part of why being a parent today is how hard, especially when so much of the world is still unconscious
True	The world is so much different now than when I was a kid being a parent would be hard.
False	If I do win, I may have to share the winnings with my Reddit family as I post there a lot.
False	Yeah, people do like impulse spending that comes with wagering money.
True	And honestly, that would be me. I'd have to buy a new car that was blue because I LOVE the color blue.
False	What kind of car would you get, what would be your dream car?
True	Probably an Aston Martin Vanquish because James Bond drives it. But instead of silver, I'd have to have a blue one. lol
True	That's a very nice car! Yeah, that's something I would get too.
True	I know it sounds crazy, but I'm obsessed with the color blue. Like, I only like Facebook because they use the color blue.
True	Haha, my shirt is kind of blue, i guess it is a really cool and versatile color. Reminds me of Sonic the Hedgehog
True	Indeed it does! Makes me miss that old game. I guess his color was why I loved it so much!
True	Yeah! I love video games myself, i design them for a living. 
True	I grew up in Mississippi so I am used to it being hot
True	I understand that, usually in cold whether I stay in home watching YouTube videos
False	What kind do you like to watch
True	Mostly gaming videos and movies trailers you know
False	Do you play any video games yourself or do you just enjoy watching them
True	Kinda bit of both, sometimes I write on my spare time
False	That sounds interesting. How did you get into that?
True	Basically just thoughts that pop up in my head and I write them down
True	The most writing that I do is making a note in my iPhone and then forgetting about it for 5 months. 
True	Its like this, when I have a lot of stuff written down I revise them to see if I can make a story out of it
True	I have 2 golden retrievers. What type of dogs do you have?
True	I have a Husky and a maltese Shiz Tzu. They are my little babies!
True	Aww, I bet they are gorgeous! My parents love my pets too and treat them like grandkids. haha.
True	Mine too! They are definitely loved and treated like our kids by the whole family. How long have you had your babies?
True	I have had mine for 3 years? Do you enjoy dressing them up for Halloween?
True	Oh yes! This year they will be dressed up as Count Dracula and Mrs. Dracula. I cant wait! do you dress them up on halloween?
True	I dressed mine up as clowns last years as a tribute to my father and grandfather who worked for a circus! Fun theme.
True	How fun! I am thinking about dressing up as a bat to match my babies Dracula theme!
False	Aww, that is a great idea. I am still thinking about this year. There are so many ideas that I love. Any suggestons?
False	Not really, there are cute ideas on the internet. I would try looking there
False	Really?  That sounds fascinating.
False	It can be difficult sometimes but he seems to enjoys it.
True	That comes along with the job.  I am also an attorney.

False	It can be.  Lots of details to remember.  But it is never boring.
True	i just work with individuals . i enjoy working with the elderly most .
False	Are you in a private practice?
True	I do a little of both.
False	That sounds like a lot going on!
False	It can be sometimes, what are your hobbies?

True	I like the Eagles. What about you?
False	sad to say, i am not into sports. but if i was into sports, my college team would be bama and my pro team would be the cowboys
False	so you've never been tailgating then?
True	no ... i am one of those homebodies who gets a thrill out of netflix, a cup of hot peppermint tea and a good book.
True	Binge watching is a hell of a lot better than binge drinking, that's alcoholism in a nutshell. My favorite Netflix show is Ozarks
True	lol ... mine is  .... (in my whisper voice) lucifer.  i was raised in a strict christian household. lol!
False	never seen it before but i've heard good things
False	it is insanely crazy. if it is not against your moral aptitude, you should watch it. lol. it was great chatting with you. have a good one!
False	will do! nice chatting
False	My brownies! Ugh, the kitchen smells horrible now haha
False	Oh no! Do you burn foods often?
False	No, hardly ever! I'm a great cook but not the best at baking. Maybe I should just stick to writing. Aspiring journalist here
False	Very lucrative career. What do you write about?
False	Generally politics. I am fascinated by what motivates politicians to do the outlandish things they do.
False	I'm more of a fan of the past than the present. I like the Victorian era.
True	My mom is a librarian, I grew up in a home that was more focused on fiction and the past. I'm more interested in here and now
True	My mom owned a doll store. I collect them now. My favorite is a doll that looks like Queen Victoria.
False	I could understand your love for history in that case. That's more interesting than some of the boring things she would read to us kids haha
False	What books would she read to you?
False	What are you favorite fillings or toppings for tacos?
True	 I love chicken and chorizo with sour cream, cilantro, and onion
True	That sounds good, minus the cilantro. I am not a fan of it.
False	that is too bad ! ! you are missing out !
True	So I've been told. I can tolerate it in some salsas, but only freshly made ones.
False	Fresh made salsa is the only way to go! Do you like any other Hispanic food?
True	I enjoy most anything that comes in a tortilla, or can be eaten with a tortilla. Especially taquitos
True	Me too! I love tortas, quesadillas, and horchata!
False	Oh, quesadillas, I somehow forgot about those. A local restaurant makes the best ones.
False	Do you like food trucks?
True	My older brother plays in the NFL. I worry every time he's out there, but I know he's doing what he loves.
False	He is a professional I'm sure he will be alright.
False	All the head trauma controversy is making me nervous; sometimes you don't know you were effected until much later in life.
False	You see this happen with hockey, players being affected well into the retirement.
True	I like to watch hockey, but I am not very knowledgeable about the sport in general.
True	I like the action, although I have been distracted lately, I keep thinking about the lovely Rita Hayworth
False	She definitely is an icon, but that's a pretty random choice. Did you watch one of her movies recently?
True	I was black and white older movies and she caught my eye. 
False	She was a beautiful dancer as well as a great actress.
True	I would love to dance with her in the rain. It sounds romantic. What do you think? Am I crazy?
True	Oh yeah they are. Finally after years of hard work they have a place they own.
False	Ever thought about traveling to celebrate such occasion? Maybe you can join me to see the pyramids.
False	Seems like a strange thing to ask. But no, I personally cannot afford to go on big trips out of the country.
True	That's fair. How close are you with your sister?
True	Were pretty close, I talk to her a few times a month but she lives out of state so.
False	Oh. Perhaps you can go visit her and visit that new place. Does their new place have a pool?
False	Yeah, I might go sometime in a few months when I save up some cash, No theres no pool but its really close to some cool hiking trails
False	Oh nice. Yes traveling cost must be quite hefty. Are you into hiking? 
False	Yes! I really enjoy hiking, spending hours in nature.

True	"I have never seen it but I really enjoyed ""Into Darkness"", one of the latest movie. Have you seen it?"
True	Yes I did like it, although a little to 'Hollywood'y for my tastes!
True	I agree with you on that. Movies like that always make me think on how scary the future might be one day. Do you feel the same way?
True	Yeah absolutely, although the future is already here - the truck I drive already feels like a space ship with all the new technology!
True	i never thought about it like that . i love your perspective !

False	they were honking at me and flashing their brights, wasnt till i pulled over a noticed a tail light out

False	this is true if only there was a way to better communicate on the road
False	Maybe someone will invent some gadget one day to help! Were you going anywhere fun when you were honked at?
False	Maybe they will. not only was tail light out bad weather was just 5 mins away

False	It is a legendary towel made popular by a television salesman. It is super absorbent. 
False	Sounds great, I bet I could re-sell it for 3 easy payments of $9.99.
False	What agricultural zone do you live in? I'm afraid the frost would kill them in my area.
True	I live up north actually, so I am only able to garden in the summer months. Its a short season!
True	I live in the south, so if you have good luck growing strawberries up north, it sounds like I should have no problem.
False	It should be easy!  It grows quick and you can consume them in large quantities.  Strawberries are super delicious with chocolate.
False	That's a great idea! I think chocolate strawberries and a night on the beach are an example of a perfect day for me.
False	that sounds like a great combination .
False	What is your idea of a perfect day?
True	I like to kayak - so any day I can get out on the water is a perfect day to me!
True	Fishing from a kayak is one of my favorite things to do. Especially in the evening.

False	working with kids is so much fun. It is grate you are helping them develop skills. Do you help out in other local groups?
False	Yeah, I work my city's community garden group to support urban permaculture -- basically, parks full of free food. How about you? What's your jam?

True	Yeah I got an old car from my dad that kept breaking down when I was in college! Are you singing in the show?
True	Why yes as well as dancing too. Do you have a better car now?
True	That sounds fun! I used to do a bit of musical performance when I was younger. I have the same car actually but I don't drive as often now.
True	Oh, I drive a lot to put on my show and the hamburgers I eat keep me going. Are you living in a city then with mass transit?
True	I also love hamburgers, I probably eat far too much lol. Yeah I use buses and trams to get around now mainly.

True	Yes, I got to see him when I lived in NC, and took all of my grandchildren. It was a great show.
True	nice! do you like playboi carti?
True	Not a big fan, but he's okay. Are you a big fan?
True	yes, i love die lit and self title, do you like the young thug?
True	Yes, I like young thug better. Been to a concert lately?
True	no i haven't, what is your favourite thug album?
True	So Much Fun. Your favorite?
True	It's not that I don't like them, I just really like having room to mess around and play without bothering anyone.
True	I know what you mean. Like play loud music or having BBQs at night for apparent reason
True	Lol, I'm kind of the opposite, I like building projects and the noise can bother people sometimes. I also like the quiet so I can focus on my hobbies.
True	What's your hobbies? I like to go hiking on the weekends
True	you knit? That's awesome.  How long have you done that?
True	it's been about 2 years now or more. when i got my cat speckles i would sit by the window with him for hours on end sometimes. Hows your garden?

True	Yes I was.  It was a great experience.  Were you on a swim team as well?
True	ehh I am an ok swimmer enough to keep me alive lol but never enough to be on a team. It was more of a hobby, are you still swimming?
True	Yes, but I would have to go overseas.
True	I'm truly sorry to hear. I have a reddish-brown hair color so I always feel discriminated against when I'm passed over for others at work.
True	I'm sorry that you feel this way.  I am a heavy set women and feel the same way so I completely understand ya.
True	But all we can do is push on. I feel as if eventually they will realize they made a serious mistake.
True	yes most definitely.  
True	Like, I broke my arm in a skiing accident and thought I'd never be useful again. Now my arm is 100% and I feel like it never happened.
True	 That is wonderful! I have MS and because of it have fallen several times and messed up my hips and back.
True	I hate hearing that. How long does it take you to recover from a fall?
True	I have been doing therapy for about 3 months now.  I am slowly coming back around.
True	Well I wish you a speedy recovery. I've heard using parallel bars for walking is the best form of PT in your situation.
False	Thank you, Don't you think the same?
False	Yes, I do believe that everyone has a purpose.  I once fell up an entire flight of stairs with only a bruise or two, so I definitely have faith
True	Yes, I do love to bake, and skateboard, which is a strange combination, but I love it!
False	Those sound like 2 extreme opposites, which can be exhilarating! Creating a cake, pleasure to others, and skateboarding. . . wow
True	Yes, the cool part is you get to wear grungy clothes for both!! I don't even have to change:)
True	LOL! Well, as a baker, I'm sure you have to be a taster as well. Skateboarding sounds like it keeps the pounds off. I'm watching the figure myself.
True	Hahaha! I do eat a lot of cake and it does help. Are you trying to fit into a wedding dress? Maybe it's your cake I'm baking..lol
False	I wish! :-D How soon do you have to bake it? How long does it take? Do you already have a design in mind? sounds like a fascinating career.
True	I have to make it by Friday, the wedding is Saturday! It takes a few days to construct. It will be a 3 tier cake with champagne fountain!
False	Yummy! Well more power to you! side job - or professional [went to school for it]/career?  
True	Thank you! I went to school for 4 years at Johnson & Wales University in Rhode Island.
True	well, I'm not doing much these days, except job hunting myself. your life/career sounds fascinating. I'm proud of you -& don't even know you :-)
True	I have chronic back pain too. It can be frustrating. How long has it been going on?
True	It has probably been about 8 months are so
False	Wow, that's a long time. Have you seen a doctor to find out what might be causing it? Mine is a pinched nerve from a slipped disk. 
True	I have seen a doctor today. He give me lab tests to do but I am afraid of the results.
True	The waiting is the worst part if you ask me. The uncertainty. Did the doctor do any imaging tests?
True	Well the MRI was clear but my mother has MS and it can be diagnosed with an MRI - so it was a bit nerve wracking to say the least.
False	Yes, I have MS but not spinal, I actually suffer from the brain lesions. Luckily it hasn't flared up since 2017
False	that is quite interesting , have you ever thought of having it removed ?
True	I've only had one flare up so it's early at this point, but I will if it does flare up

True	 how you feel! This was my fear at first but I book those flights and go. I want to learn how to fly a plane soon lol.
False	Wow that sounds really fun. I would like to do that too, but not sure I could. 
False	Listen I am scared but it's on my bucket list and I just have to lol!!! Do you have crazy things on your bucket list? 
True	I don't know. I really want to go skydiving. Have you ever been?
True	No I have never jumped out of a plane. I am too scared although I like parachutes and their light and strong fabric.
False	I think you might like them if you were to try them. 
False	is there a certain way i should prepare them?
True	I prefer to saute them, but a lot of people like them in salads. 
False	Sauteed? Do you eat them alone?
False	I like to stir in onion, garlic and red pepper flakes while they are cooking.
False	Do you have a favorite recipe with them?
False	Yeah, I really love sautÃ©ed dandelion greens with eggs in the morning. 
True	Sounds good, i rarely eat breakfast. 
False	Breakfast is very important and it only takes about 10 minutes to make! 
True	You are right, i am always so busy in the morning. 
False	They are quick to whip up but, you can always try with a dinner recipe if your not up for cooking in the morning, 
False	That sounds better. Are you vegetarian?
False	She is the shift lead on the taco truck now!  What about yours?

False	It sure is! I love tacos myself so it's great for me!
False	I like to be alone so my girlfriend and I work different shifts. She is a waitress
False	That would be nice, sounds lovely!  Does she enjoy it?
False	For the most part. She works handling a lot of cash. Can't be all bad, right?
True	"Not at all, I work in a ""cash only"" business myself!"
False	I say whatever brings home the bacon! 
False	As long as I'm putting food on the table nobody is asking questions.
False	As long as the bills are paid! 
False	I know that's true. But I don't think I got the time for it. Plus I like to try different food
False	There's some great cookbooks for cooking a meal in less than 15 minutes!
False	Yeah...if you have all the ingredients they want you to have...Haha! There is always 1 thing that's missing im my fridge
True	True, although I used some of the services that deliver the ingredients to you for a specific meal, it's really useful
False	Hmm, I never thought about that! Do you cook at home a lot? 
False	All the time, it's so much healthier and much cheaper. With some planning you can have a good variety too
True	That's true! What type of job do you do? 
True	I'm retired, so I guess that helps, means I have plenty of spare time to cook!
False	Oh that's why! I guess I have to wait quite a while to reach that time of my life...You must be very relaxed!
False	I am indeed. What do you do?
False	The Catholic Church did not help 
False	That's weird conclusion. But, Da Vinci does definitely hold secrets and died with them. He even might have created that very bizarre and undecipherable medieval book.
False	If you think about it, the Pope and his circle were opposing this new idea at the time
False	 Yes; exactly. Protestants rejected the Roman Catholic doctrine of papal supremacy and sacraments
False	Imagine how difficult it was to fight such an affirmed establishment
False	Oh yes you get it even tough they encountered various struggles following the creation of the Church of England
False	I love the fact that science is freedom. I would love to learn more but I work a lot

True	Thats why I always try to avoid climbing heights, to avoid breaking anything
False	Right?!  It's a rich history
False	sure is! and there is a lot of history too begining in 1607....
False	I had no idea it went back that far.  Where did you find that information?
False	I done searches online, went to the library, and even visited some universities to see what information they found
False	Wow, you're quite the historian. I do love doing that kind of research, though
True	I enjoy learning about new and different things so that is a plus. Research is great, it's like putting together a puzzle.
False	I actually work in research for a living.  I think my dad gave me that love.
True	Your dad is a smart man, that is awesome!
False	It's a fascinating job.  I review research done in humans (you know, clinical trials) for ethics
False	That is amazing...I love that field. so many exciting new things every day.
False	I tried to be vegan, but I ended up feeling worse. Maybe i did it wrong?
False	It is not easy for sure.
False	I've read a lot about taking supplements to keep levels in check. Do you do any of that?
True	No, I don't take any supplements but try to be mindful of the nutrients in what I eat.
False	That makes sense. Do you have any advice?
True	It takes commitment and patients to experiment with foods that work for you.
False	Fair enough. Have you always been vegan?
True	No, only about 5 years.
False	Do you miss anything from before you were vegan?
True	I miss eggs and cheese the most.
False	It makes sense, most make a decision at a young age that affects them for a large part of their lives.
False	I believe it is the toughest and most important decision to make.
True	There should be more guidance on the matter of choosing a career. I thought my decision was going to be irreversible. 
False	there are other options in life but you must always follow your heart when making such important decisions.
True	I disagree. Not everyone can be what they wish. Sometimes you have to follow your head, and even that doesn't always work out. 
False	I see your point.  It is a good one!
False	I myself changed the direction of my education multiple times. There were benefits but ultimately it was a mistake. 
True	I believe that.  I also changed directions and it put me behind many years.
True	It is comforting that others have similar issues. But this is why I mentioned there should be greater guidance during the early years of picking a career path.
False	Exactly it is such a crucial decision
True	They love softball but I used to play when I was little and got kidnapped by my uncle one day after practice so softball games make me feel sad.
False	I hear that memory isn't very accurate sometimes... maybe it wasn't as bad as I remember? Your dad is a nice guy.

True	That's true. Maybe I'll start out in a tent lol.
False	Just look for an old cabin for sell then fix it up.

False	practice can always help . but i'm sure competition might be intimidated .
False	Probably cruising in my mustang! what about you?
False	IÂ´d love to get in the mountains and check any tree leaves still changing colours.
False	I love the cold weather, would move there in a heartbeat.
False	Oh, not me. I'd much rather live in a warmer climate, but it would be nice to visit once.
False	I wonder if there is n ice bar there?
False	There's gotta be. Gotta have a nice place to stay warm at drink at.

False	I am not in a band but I have been playing for about 4 years, do you play an instrument?
True	No I was never the instrument type I almost flunked band in high school lol. I do like the piano but just can't play at all. 
True	Awww that's a shame, its amazing being able to connect to the music
True	I know like I want to learn piano because I desire it but at this age I feel like my brain can't handle learning the keys and notes lol. 
False	I understand that, it can be difficult and quite difficult to pick up and not everyone has it you know ... Do you have any hobbies?
False	Yea I am trying to help her everytime I can also it help me collect enough money for my goal.
False	That's cool, what are you trying to collect money for?
False	buying huge macaroni bag at costco to make macaroni art. 
True	Oh wow! I love macaroni, but usually with cheese:) I would probably eat my art.
False	ahah yea thats the hard part about this hobby. Not eating your project..
True	Well, if you did eat it, I wouldn't judge you! What type of art do you create with the macaroni?
False	Contemporary art, its hard to explain. I paint each macaroni individually and make things like bridge and dog
True	I can dig that! I saw a piece of art yesterday that was made out of individually splash painted toy soldiers! Who can judge art.
False	oh yea I know this piece of art. Its in one of the encyclopedia I am selling with its history and creator biography. 
True	Really, wow, I've had the same job for eight years and this is the first time I've seen anything like it. I guess I need to get out more.

True	I have 4 cats and planning to get a puppy in a few months. Have you had your pets since they were small?

False	Oh yes, they are my little friends and we live in our own little fantasy world. Just us. Haha.
False	Sounds cozy. I usually prefer to hang out with animals over people as well. :) Do the dogs and cat get along well?
True	Oh, they are best friends. I made sure when I adopted them they were okay around each other. My other dog eventually warmed up to them.
False	I am a little worried because my cats are pretty content with no other animals around. They've never been around dogs, so not sure how they'll react to a puppy
False	I think they will eventually warm up to them. You may have to get 2 dogs so they can play with each other and won't bother the cats.
False	Oh man. I haven't had a dog since I was a teenager, so I'm nervous enough about getting one. Cats seem easier.
False	wow, impressive.  did you decide to change careers?

False	What kind of plants do you have ? Any vegetables ? Does it receive direct sunlight ?
True	it's all vegetables, season is almost over though. Last thing I had was pumpkins. 
True	Pumpkins are very nice but they take a lot of space. For my anxiety I like to visit museums, art in general relax me.
False	I have you ever been to the MET in NYC?
True	Yes, several times and believe me my anxiety was gone during the hours spent there. 
True	I used to go there all the time when I was younger. To the Guggenheim too.

True	No, I went to my neighbor's house and wiped it on their porch
False	LOL! I bet your neighbors were happy to have such a beautiful edition to your neighborhood.
True	They better. I am sick of them waking me up in the morning. That's what they get
True	Ugh, that is inconsiderate of them. What do they do?
True	They are always up blasting music super early. I dont know why they cant just wear ear buds

False	two years
True	And is that what you blog about?

True	now i will go lunch. after the lunch i will give tips
True	Good call. I'm getting hungry, too.
True	My dog is as well. And he even likes his clay model. lol I've also made a clay model of mount Everest as I hope to climb it someday!
True	Wow, that would be a huge accomplishment if you did it!
True	Indeed. Although it would take a long time to prep considering the danger and conditions, ya know?
True	That is true! I bet it is taking a lot of time, but accomplishing that would be entirely worth it. 
False	So true. It's just too bad I couldn't take my dogs with me, right? Ha!
True	haha definitely not! That would be way too dangerous. So what else are you into?
True	I enjoy a nice classic movie every now and again. Matter of fact, I watched Gone With The Wind recently and it always makes me cry.
False	Oh okay! I've always heard about it, but unfortunately have never watched it. I love movies in general though. 
False	"at 7:00 and now its 9:00, the person who was serve had an ""emergency"""
False	I hate when that happens. Life is so unfair.
True	It is! but lately I've been trying to roll with the punches but it's just to hard sometimes.
True	It is. Have you tried yoga and meditation?
True	no but i always wanted to. is it really worth it?
True	I think so. It helps me relax after a hard day at school.
False	maybe i will have to try it. just afraid that it will be wasting my time if it i don't see results.
True	The stress needs to go. Everything is temporary! What do you do for fun?
False	"very true, and is work considered ""fun""? haha"
True	I guess, if you like your job! What do you do? I'm keeping my grades up because I want to be a veterinarian.
True	I planned my first cruise to Alaska
True	Your first cruise? Or first one to Alaska?
True	Both!  Im so excited
True	A cruise would suit me well. I only eat fish, so I'd fit in nicely.
True	I love fish.  I like to fish and eat them.  I am primarily a fish eater myself.
True	I'm on a weird diet where the only thing I can eat is fish. I'm kind of sick of it.
True	Some fish are great for you.  They say that everyone should incorporate it in a weekly diet.
True	Yeah. I forget what it is they have. Oxy-something or something. But it's hard because of all the media that says how dangerous it can be.
True	Very true but the media likes to over exagerate things also.  I would recommend eating what your comfortable with and what our body is going to handle.
True	Well, I'm a Democrat. So I kind of trust the news.
True	I will try to keep that in mind. 
True	Thank you for the advice. Next time, I'm gonna follow that
True	I really would like to have a pool for the hot summers though. 
True	Yes, me too. I just like to stay in the pool for a long time doing nothing
True	After working at the zoo all day it would be nice to come home and jump in the pool.

True	I'm really into bowling - are there computer games about bowling?
False	Absolutely. Actually some pretty good ones.
False	wow, maybe I should check one sometime. are there any that you play?
True	I love the online card games.
False	I've never been a fan of card games - I find them kind of boring.
False	I get it. I find Bowling kind of boring.
False	lol, fair enough. what else do you like to do then?
True	I love taking vacations to the Caribbean.
True	I don't know? I guess school and stress just gets to people sometimes.
True	Yeah it can be more than a normal temporary reaction to life events. Although I try to keep perspective like a lot of people struggle with this and worse problems.
True	I know. Just hard to believe that my roommate would be rummaging through my things. I wonder if she has been stealing from me?
False	its totally possible. Did you get to find out why she did that?
True	I haven't spoken with her about it yet. I just caught her on video going through my desk. How do you bring something like that up?
False	definitely possible
True	I don't like confrontation, and this is not a discussion I am looking forward to having. But I have to stand up for myself.
False	have you tried confronting her?
False	I tried to bring it up yesterday but she was in a hurry to get out the door.
False	i'd suggest you find a time you're sure she's not going out and talk about it
False	That makes sense. Vigilance is a great preventative. 
True	I am a security guard so it is very important.
True	Are you concerned that you are going to be replaced with a security robot? I listened to a great 99% Invisible about them plus a documentary called Chopping Mall.
True	I have never thought of that. I just finished training so I should be ok for a few years.
True	Yeah I think you've got a lot of time. I worry about AI. I don't think that it'll be like Star Wars at all.
True	I think in the long run it will benefit society but there will be some issues along the way. 
False	There are just going to be tons of lost jobs and AI often has so much bias built in from the coding and learning process.
False	Yeah that could be an issue. How do you think governments and people can prepare?
False	we need to regulate the jobs that can be automated, we need a robust UBI and social safety net, and companies need to be much more careful about developing them.
False	That definitely makes a lot of sense. 
False	What do you mean by off the chains?
False	Just crazy songs in general I think! Like rock, pop, and hip pop
True	Huh! Ive never been too big of a fan of those genres but they arent bad!
True	Sometimes you have to be in the mood, but overall I love those genres
True	Well speaking of things we like, how do you feel about nascar?

True	Oh! neat, your dad sounds like the kind of person I would call a friend
True	Yeah he is a great guy, I hope to be like him one day.
True	Oh where do you go for work? Is it that bad? 
True	I dont hate the job, but I really just dont want to do it for the rest of my life
True	Oh that's a bummer. Maybe you can join me at the military. It's a great exciting job with good benefits and purpose.
True	Thanks, But I would rather be a video game developer
True	Oh have you always wanted to be one? Were you an avid video gamer?
True	Yea, since like forever
True	Oh I never knew that! Maybe you can help develop a new baking game! One that teaches how to many good brownies!
True	Now thats an idea Hahaha.
True	Yup. I am sure with your talent you can make it happen! Maybe we work together even in the future!
True	That would be cool!
False	Did you enjoy it?

False	Yeah its a good duration and so interesting it takes your mind of the pain of driving haha 
False	I'm glad you can relate haha. Do you listen to any other podcasts?
True	Yeah I listen to a couple of others.  I am always on the look out for a good one.

True	and i work as an accountant
False	how do you enjoy working as an accountant?
True	i do enjoy dealing with money,lol!

False	I have heard sometimes it can be boring
True	yes it can..you know doing same routines everyday for many years.
True	yes, I like having a new challenge everyday in my work
False	yes we all could love that.but it happens very rarely.

True	I was transporting huge wood logs around America.
False	I see, what was the wood going to be used for? I bet the butterflies will miss them.
False	All sort of thing from furniture to paper. Butterflies are living more in meadows than forest. So no real harms was done.
True	Thank you for expanding my knowledge of butterflies! I love them so much. You know, my favourite hero Flash could assemble furniture in a flash.
True	Is flash part of the avenger? I don't have a lot of knowledge in super heroes
False	I think he is part of the Marvel universe, but not an Avenger. Sometimes I get DC and Marvel superheroes confused. I am ashamed I do not know this.
True	They all confuse me. I was a big fan of x-men though when I was younger.
False	I thought so. My doctor, not so much.
False	I hope you don't get any bad news from the doctor.
False	It wouldn't be the first time. He told me he likes country music and that almost killed me!
True	Do you like cars? I have a black mazda that i love
True	I drive a red mazda!
True	how long have u owned that car for?
False	A few years, had to drive it up from Florida though. I hate hot weather.

False	The heat is the worst. I'm sure it's bad when you go out recruiting.
False	It's even worse for the soilders training lol

False	I really want to be able to travel all over the world to teach the learnings
False	That would be a nice gig. Which part of the world do you want to explore next?
True	Well, Spain for sure. Germany is a close second thoughg

True	Thank you for your concern. It has been hard, but I will do my best to move forward.

True	Well, considering how much work a couple teen boys can be, you probably don't have any time to spare for pets.
True	yes...i had cats years ago before i had kids...always wanted another cat but life got so busy...maybe when they move out
True	Cats are great for companions once you have an empty nest, for sure. No worries, I'm sure someday you will be able to get another furry friend. :)
True	we all get along great....it probably wouldnt be a big deal but we have so many activities i feel they'd get neglected
True	 Luckily, cats tend to do their own thing, hence why they make great pets for busy people.
True	this is true!! you can even leave them for short periods...like overnight and they are pretty chill. 
True	Absolutely! Unlike dogs, who NEED you constantly. haha

False	I can understand that. Does the family watch football with you?
True	Sometimes, but I'm definitely the sports fan in the family. Do you follow any sports teams?
True	No, sadly, sports is not my thing. My son like to play a pick-up football game when he can. 
True	It's starting to get a bit chilly to do anything outside around here. It's almost time to break out the board games.
True	That sounds good! We like to set up a board game by the fireplace to play.
True	I wish we had a fireplace. That and a hot bowl of chili would make for a perfect night. 
True	You may want to try a video of a fireplace, playing on your TV, to make it feel that way.  The chili would be perfect!

True	My mother took me a lot as a kid. My dad left when I was only 5, so she took me there to get my mind off of it.

False	Agreed. I wish I was talented enough to paint. Do you ever paint any rollercoaster portraits?
True	No, I never have.  I can visualize one peeking out over the trees from a distance though.  Joins nature and civilization in a whimsical way.
False	I bet your portraits are amazing! I get as much of a thrill out of nature as I do rollercoasters.
True	I wish I lived near the mountains...so much more variety in nature. But I have learned to find the beauty of the plains.

True	On donation. Its not a lot, but I don't need a lot. I only eat rice with vegetables and drink only water to purify my body.
True	wow thats interesting. I don't think i could do that, I have a big family
False	I understand its not for everyone. If you are interested, you can start by being vegan. Its a good step in the right direction
True	Can't do that lol I love meat too much. I am an avid hunter, and fisherman. I live off what I harvest. 
False	Its another way of living life. We believe in reincarnation so for me, all animals are sacred.

False	I enjoyed it. Will you be getting Disney Plus?
False	Yes. I live with my parents in their old age, and my kids at home. It will be good for the whole family
False	There will be many things for you all to watch together.
False	Exactly! I figure that is more family friendly than a lot of alternatives I would watch on my own haha
False	Oh my! That sounds incredibly interesting but also a bit scary!
False	Yes  spiders can be scary, and best not to be bit and have to get anti-venom.
False	I find spiders interesting when I see them outdoors in their habitat but when I see one in my house I don't like them at all.
False	Some spiders have spots like the freckles I have, its crazy.
True	That's funny. We have brown recluse spiders in the area where I live. They have a tiny shape like a fiddle on their backs.
False	Scarry. My friend is from tanzania, and they have big Baboon Spiders that can really hurt you.
False	I do remind myself of their good qualities. I like the fact that they eat other bugs, keeping them at bay.
False	I agree, they play a major role in the world keeping incects at bay.
False	It's pretty amazing the way nature functions. I am fascinated by all the creatures and beauty around us.
True	I am as well, but I will always still be nervous around the spiders tho.
False	No just someone I saw on the train 
False	It happens, whether you're pretty or not. Lol.
False	I was so embarrassed 
False	I would be too. What do you like to do for fun, do you have any hobbies?

False	we have that in common 
False	I never thought I would like hiking but it's really a great chance to take in the beauty of nature.
False	yes that is so true
True	The altitude really got the best of me though, because I really wasn't quite acclimated before my hike.
False	Yes it was a terrible situation . My husband will be home from work soon and he can bury Samson, He works a telecom.
True	At one time I was a nurse. Death hurts the living tremendously.
False	Yes death hurts, but I think I may have hit the cat myself I am a frustrated driver. I hope she did not suffer.
True	I remember a time my husband hit and killed our puppy with a car. It was very hard to deal with.
True	Samson was a good cat and she was a orange tabby. The weather was raining this morning and I could not see the road very well.
False	I am so sorry for you. Will you and your husband bury Samson yourselves?
False	Yes we will bury her in the backyard just as soon as it quits raining.

False	ouch. did it hurt
True	No, it just like someone pinching your elbow really hard

True	lots of passing down stuff from the older to the younger ones
True	O that makes sense! How many boys/girls so you have
True	9 girls 2 boys. I need a vacation.
True	Haha yea I imagine! Where would you go

True	I also love to travel, specially in the summer time
False	I travel for work mostly these days but can't wait to travel more for leisure. I most want to see the Northern Lights one day!
False	What type of work you do?
False	We rode in one once.  To a funeral.  High class.  Was afraid to touch anything.
False	That is what is keeping me from purchasing one. My dog is my #1 sidekick and he sheds so that is a problem.
True	Dogs are man's best friend lol.  We're going to the opera next week.  Madame Butterfly.  For the 15th time.
False	Wow you must really be fans.  Is it a dinner and date night? Any good restaurant suggestions that aren't vegan?
True	Yes, but just a quick trip.  We're flying into NYC, staying for about 3 days.  Then back home.
True	I visited NYC this summer.  I liked it! I like the business of it.
False	Busy place.  Need to set up reservations at good hotels to really experience the city.  Worth the money.
True	Absolutely! How long is that flight from where you are?
False	About 4 hours.  Driving is a nightmare.
True	I can imagine.. Probably about as bad as the drive from TX to California. That is brutal.
False	I love gone with the wind? do you like that movie?
False	I have never seen the movie. I'm sure I'm missing out.
False	you have to go see it. OMG!!

False	What kind of dog do you have?
False	Bull Dog named Dozer 
False	That's great name for a bull dog. 
False	I agree, I wish people would take more care
False	I wish there was more I could do for the wild life.
False	yeah me too, I need to start eat less fish, that will help
False	It isn't healthy to eat fish more than once a week. Too much MSG.
False	then it'll be good for me too
False	Yeah, I've been trying to recycle more and use eco friendly products.   
False	Think everyone needs to make a huge effort for the environment
False	I agree. I try and do what I can. I encourage my kids too.  
False	Ah that's great
False	Its hard with our day and age. So much going on , you just have to focus on your small part as best you can ya know?
False	Ouch. how did you break it?
False	I was not paying attention and i tripped over a big piece of wood.
True	My husband works to work at a lumber yard and gets hurt alot.lol But thankfully he gets to retire next year so no more doctor visits for tripping,,lol
False	Thats great news, are you all planning to travel or anything?
False	Yeah,since I love to walk we are thinking of going somewhere to hike .
True	Thats sounds fun, and there is alot of great places to go.
True	we are thinking about the Grande Canyon this year.
False	I have never been there but I hear its beautiful.
True	I havent either but Ive allways wanted to go.So Im excited to see it in person
False	i have only seen it from a plane but that doesnt count.
False	It kind of does. just like Ive never flown anywhere ecept when i went skydiving last month .lol So i kinda flew.

False	I know what you mean. You feel like you deserve it.
False	Yes, it is also a good way to start the day
False	Star, continue and finish. And don't forget the rum. Wink, wink!
False	haha yes, Rum is the answer. What do you do in the morning?
True	Oh? I'd love to hear those. Especially while I'm sitting back fishing from my boat. I love to go fishing
True	Fishing is truly fun. We occasionally go with my friends too. Do you go frequently?
True	Well, I currently work at a deli counter so I have plenty of free time. I try to go as much as possible.
False	I'd like to go fishing more but none of my friends are interested. My job gives me the opportunity to go a lot also. DO you go alone?
True	I sometimes take my significant other with me. It's something I enjoy being alone with myself doing. 
True	I would like to go someday but not alone my husband works alot so when I'm alone I have my music while fishing. Who's favorite music artist ?
False	I understand. My favorite would have to be Marvin Gaye or Tracy Chapman
True	I love them both omg!!! It is hard to pick one out of those to lol. I love Michael Jackson .

False	He wanted me to open some candy up, I was buying it for Halloween.
False	Im pretty sure I did the same thing to my parent. Did he calm down? 
False	He did after a while but not before the whole store was staring at me.  It's necessary but it's so hard to give tough love
True	I dont have any kids, just my cat Charlie.
True	I love cats but we live in an apartment temporarily, my husband doesn't want any pets right now.  
True	Must be nice to have a family. My favorite food is pizza but having a family to cook for would be nice
True	The everyday hustle and bustle is hard with 2 kids, dinner, homework, bedtime and all the sorts.  Dinner is usually something easy during the week!
False	Sounds like quite the balancing act! 
True	i don't have any free time to read, i wish i could! I'm working on my wedding for starters!
False	Congrats on getting merried! wish i could go, i have to work all week though. 
False	what's your job like? do you ever get to rest? i can't imagine the stress.
True	i worked 10 hours a day, i had to make breakfist before going, but i get so tired alot having to help alot of people. 
True	I hear that. it's a tough but rewarding profession. i'm lucky i got off for our honeymoon to niagra falls. 
True	very rewarding indeed. helping people is the best and i make $20 every hour to buy whatever i need for my house. :) and Niagra sounds great!
False	$20 an hour? You deserve a raise! I hope it is. I hear it's cold this time of year.
False	yup. very cold. wish it was warmer here. :(
False	I hate the cold! But out of season trips are cheap! When are you going to take your vacation? 
True	about a week from November 6. but i would had to gaet back on athe 7th to help with the Doctor on heart surgery. 
True	Ah yes. I have played my share of video games as well. We get snowed in often in where I live in Vermont.
True	I like the video version because you can play anywhere, anytime. So you are an avid golf player as well? or just your friend? 
True	We are trying to visit all us national parks starting with ones next to golf coarses. We have been to 12 so far.
False	very ambitious! you are traveling with family then? that can be tricky - schedule and some want to rest, sleep in.
True	Not always family, friends mostly. What other video games are you into?
False	I looked up: Golfing in our National Parks | National Park Foundation. It seems to be quite a number of parks. Me, various - down time on flights.
True	Do you travel alone? Is if for work?
True	for work. sales person. pharmaceutical. some days hum-drum. other days, depending on location, it's a pick-me-up all by itself. :-D
True	Hum, do you enjoy that? Do you get to fly first class? Gotta grab joy where you can.
True	enjoy, mostly. first class. how about you and friends that are getting away? for how long? sounds like enjoyment. what do you do for work?
True	Hah, right. Sorry I don't pay attention. I'd never even heard of Bob Marley.
False	"I loved his song Starfish & Coffee when I was little! But you have to at least know ""No Woman No Lie!"""
True	Nope, never listened to anything but metal. Heavy music lets me cut loose.
True	I've only listened to alternative myself, do you recommend any artist?
False	Start with the classics. Black Sabbath, Motorhead, Metallica, Iron Maiden. 
False	Right on, I will give them a listen. How do you feel about female singers?
True	They are amazing. Paramore has a great vocalist. We partied hard at their recent show.
False	That's super rad! If you like her you would enjoy Cleo Sol. She isn't well known yet but she is a star in her own right!
True	I'll look up Cleo Sol. I'm always open to new music, I even started listening to Bob Marley eventually!
False	 We got way too much commercial garbage on the radio. I should make it my goal to promote underground artist xD
False	I don't know.  They said they looked at it as quickly as possible.  I NEED this vacation.
True	Where are you going on vacation? I need a vacation to stay home and work on my ebook about animals.
False	Someplace fun, I'm not sure.   A city where I can explore and maybe sleep late for a change.
False	I hope you get to do what you want and enjoy your well deserved vacation!
True	Thanks!   Hey, I love animals.   What is your book going to focus on?
True	I just want to write an interesting book about all the unique and rare animals in the world.
True	It sounds more interesting than what I am working on.  I have programming homework.
False	Ok. I was just saying that my work is a bit boring also. 
True	Some of my studies are more interesting than others. This particular coding class bores me though.  
False	Are you a college student?
True	Currently taking classes in computer engineering.   I'm not quite sure what my final focus will be though.
False	Good luck with whatever you decide to focus on. I am sure you will do great.
True	Haha, that's definitely one way of putting it. As a classically trained chef, I really enjoy working with shrimp.
True	Since I cut out meat, I really miss shrimp.
False	Cut out meat? Did you do it for health or ethical reasons?
True	A little bit of both.  I really needed to cut down on red meat especially, and I was reading about all the water it takes to raise meat.
True	I've heard that as well. I try not to think about it, I have male pattern baldness and the stress of things I have little control over don't help!
False	Male pattern baldness?  What's that?
False	It's basically the way a male loses hair, you start losing hair at the hairline and it keeps going up from there.
True	I've noticed my hair is getting thinner lately.  Never used to be a problem.  Comes with age, I guess.
False	Yup, no sense in worrying about it. Eventually i just plan on shaving it all off, at some point it's more trouble than it's worth.
False	That's not fair!  Women can't do that.  I'd have to buy a wig.
False	How do people find it religious? 
False	It's an object that you attach meaning to and believe it will help you in life. What is it that interests you?
True	I love Disney movies. My favorite is Tangled. 
False	It's a very good movie. I have similar hair to the main girl character. Haha
False	I have been growing mine out for a while, but its no where as long. I love braiding though. Do you know neat braids?
False	Sure I do. That's my go to hair style. What else do you love?
True	Well I play soccer and enjoy doing that, what about you?
True	i like soccer , of course . not much into music though .
False	Thats a shame there are so many different types of music. I like to listen to a little bit of everything.
True	I am more into crystals. They are the objects I told you about earlier. They interest me the most
True	Mmm, tuna! I'm a fan.
False	I saw this really good spicy tuna and shrimp recipie but i wish i could remember what site it was on. 
False	I've never tried making sushi at home, that sounds really fun! Have you ever done it?
False	I have not , but I do want to try. I have seen where you can have someone come teach you how to make it. 
False	That sounds like a great idea, I'd have to work it around my schedule (I'm a student).
True	oh , what are you studying to be ? I'm currently a Paramedic.
True	I'm studying social sciences :)
True	what do you like about social science?
False	Yeah it really it. It's chilly but that's how it should be on Halloween
False	Exactly! Halloween should be cold and spooky,
False	I hope we get a lot of trick or treaters. I never got to be the actress I wanted to be so I use that energy to spook the kids.
False	Do you live somewhere with lots of trick-or-treaters? It sounds like fun.
True	I live in a pretty busy, small city so we get a decent amount. How about you?
True	I live in a small town also. We have a huge skateboard park that is putting on a Halloween bash!
False	That also sounds really fun.
False	yeah ! i'm so excited . what are you going to be for halloween ?
False	I've got a particularly spooky bride of frankenstein costume
False	whata  great costume ! that is perfect !
False	The child at the school where i teach
False	That's so sad. What did she do?
False	She answered back when i told her off for pushing another child.
False	Well, she better learn to be more respectful. People won't tolerate that behavior. Do you think listening to calming music in the classroom would help with the aggression?
True	Maybe, calming music soothes my nerves, that and chocolate! Do you have any suggestions?
True	Well, my favorite band is Toto, but I don't think rock music would help! Maybe one of those YouTube videos of the ocean?
False	Good idea! I will try it next time it happens. Rock music may have them rocking out.
False	What do you like to do besides teach?
True	I like to read books. What are your hobbies?
True	I like walking my dog. His name is Toto. 
True	I am starting to like cooking more.
True	I never liked it. I burn everything!
False	Do you like cold weather? I miss seeing snow.
True	I love cold weather but not keen on snow. Do you like to ski? 
True	I have never snow skiied, actually, but I love waterskiing. Would love to try it though!
True	My boyfriend lives in Italy during the winter months. He likes to ski. I dont though. 
True	Oh yeah? What does he do? I am a public affair liaison in my job.
True	He is an archaeologist. Does a lot of work in Rome.  
True	Oh wow, that sounds fun! Indiana Jones & The Temple of Doom is my favorite movie of all time.
False	He wishes it was that exciting lol! 
True	I want to get a Samsung Galaxy.
False	That's a great choice. 
False	Samsung usually makes good products.
False	Yes they have had some hiccups in the past but for the most part they do.
False	I actually bought one of their TVs.
False	That must have been expensive
False	They are, but the picture is nice.
False	is it a 4K television?
False	It is. Rather nice.
False	There's a spider on my TV right now. I am terrified.
True	I find I need my family more now that I'm out of school.
True	do you have a large or small family?
True	2 brothers, 3 sisters
True	Cool, siblings can be like really good friends if they get along. I'd say me and my sister get along pretty well.
True	I love them all. I'm the baby.
True	It's awesome to have so many siblings, do they all live close to you?
True	They're all on the West Coast, which is horrible. I'm on the East.
False	That can be very rough. Maybe you can move there soon!
True	It's too fake out there. And I have my own kids, now.
True	that's unfortunate that they are so far, do you do family reunions yearly?
False	It was fun! Do you play any instruments?
True	Nah!, I don't have a 0% knowledge in it? , I'm a good tennis player
True	Tennis is fun! I was never any good but liked to pretend I was 
True	Yeah! its good to be active for a whole day, i start my day with the tennis 
True	I typically run to get my exercise, and chase after the kids all day 
False	Lol! i think you are very cool guy!
False	Thanks 
False	really you are a drummer?
True	Used to be, dont get to play much anymore. 
False	who is your favorite?
False	I wanted a new dress. But my best friend bought the dress for herself.
False	Have you thought about the same dress in maybe a different color?
True	I dont like to match anyone, I would rather stand out. 
False	Well I guess you have two choices. Find a different dress or a new best friend!
False	True. I guess the dress would be easier 
False	Yeah, I think so too. Best friends are hard to come by these days.
True	Agreed! Do you have a best friend?
True	Maybe one. I'm not really a people person.
False	Im the same way, thats why the dress would be easier in my case. 
True	How did you meet your best friend?
True	oh thats such a interesting fact, what is your favorite color/
True	Orange is my favorite color. It reminds me of fall, specifically leaves changing and pumpkins.
True	oh, I love fall. It honestly has to be one of my favorite seasons ever. Only thing i dont like is that I can't swim.
False	Swimming is fun, but there are lots of things to do in the fall that are just as fun.
True	very true, my favorite is going to the pumpkin patch, or corn maze.  What about you?
True	I like to take dates to go watch leaves changing. Pumpkin patches can be fun too.
True	What is your least favorite season?
True	The summer. I can't stand the heat and humidity. What is yours?
True	I like swimming in summer but thats about it. I have to agree the humidity and heat is just horrible.
True	I just want it to be spring or fall all year round. I guess I should move somewhere more mild.
True	Summer, i Like the the warmer weather but not when it gets too hot
True	I prefer it over the winter if I have to make a choice
True	What do you do in spare time?
True	Stay home and watch tv, usually i order take out. i love eating
True	Yeah I love eating to
True	what is your favorite type of food?
True	Pizza for sure. you?
True	pizza is up there for me , but i am going to have to say seafood
True	I like seafood too. What about seafood pizza?
True	better with raw seafood in my opinion, but yeah i like that
False	thats really great and would like to know more
False	Its got that small town feel, but you get all the bonus of big city living
True	really cool to hear. have you ever been there?
True	we visit a lot, my aunt lives there.
True	great. when was your last visit
False	last thanksgiving, i used to go a lot more but growing up and work gets in the way
True	okay.. how about the climate over there?
False	Reaaaaaal cold at times. Paticuarly around the holiday. Have you been?
False	no im planning to visit
False	You'll love it, pick one or two things to do but make sure you get some exploring time in
False	lol Its ok you have to start somewhere, right.
False	True!  At least I  have started I suppose.  
False	Yes , that is the hardest part, I believe.
True	It really is!  I once ran a mile under 4 minutes, but that was a LONG time ago!
False	well that is great time, im sure you can bring your time down with dedication
False	We will see.  Do you enjoy running?
True	Not much running, nut I do enjoy lifting weights
False	awesome ! whats the most you have lifted ?
True	265lb bench press
False	That's impressive!  Did it take a long time to be able to bench that much?
True	Interesting. Do they have any songs where they rap too? I like rap
True	I don't really like rap. No, the organization doesn't promote or work with rap music. What songs do you like?
True	Lots of different songs, but mainly babershop and rap. You?
True	I prefer oldies myself. Rap is too new for me. 
True	Oldies is fun to listen to when I'm sleeping or napping.
True	I can't listen to music while I'm napping or sleeping. I like it really quiet. But put on oldies and I start dancing!
False	How fun! Do you have a favorite dance?
True	I can do the twist. It helps my old body stay young. 
False	I've heard dancing  is a good workout! Good cardio
False	Yes! Not only is it good cardio but it is also good for your mental state. Makes you happy and giggly. 
True	No idea. I just cleaned it up
False	that's awful! have you tried calling your local police about this? :( 
False	no, I read a lot of sci fi and I try to imagine weird ways that this stuff could have happened.
True	i love sci-fi.although, i hope this person doesn't have powers to put trash in your truck. 
False	strange things happen and makes me wonder if people could really be that trashy. Has anything like this happened to you?
True	it did, while i was working at dell yesturday. the person rush and threw a empty soda can at our boss for eating his chocolate chip cookies. 
False	oh my - - -that sounds pretty crazy. Was your boss hurt?
False	yes, he's alright. he called the cops onm the guy, but sadly he escaped. he than saw the guy again at his house outting trash on his neighbor's truck. 
False	I wonder about people - - - if the police made people clean up their own mess and pay for damages it would help deter this kind of thing.
False	yes, i agree. hopefully they catch this guy. and stop this once and for all.
True	What do you do?
True	I'm in college studying music. I love death metal.
True	Awesome! Do you have long left before graduation?

True	oh thats fun!! I take my dog Dexter, to the river alot.
True	My friends cat's name is Dexter. Did you name him from the show?
True	No, I just liked the name, well famous dex may have had some minor influence.
True	TouchÃ©! I did love that show though. Do you surf?
True	No theres not really surfing where i'm from, too cold.
True	There is definitely fun stuff to do in the cold though, have you ever snowboarded? It's surfing on land if you ask me.
False	I din't know that
False	I was surprised that Ray Croc wasn't the person who started McDonald's originally.  He's just the one that bought it and started franchising and eventually made it famous.
True	Interesting. My favorite item is the chicken strips
True	Yes, they are good.  But I personally love when the McRib is back.
True	McRib is good too. Do you remember the big and tasty?
True	Yes, I almost forgot about it.  That was a good one.  Even better than the Big Mac in my opinion.

False	Milk substitute might help, have you tried that?
False	no i haven't. whats that?
False	It's an alternative to regular milk. Such as soy, almond, etc.
True	i'm skeptical about trying new things. I get a lot of Allergies
False	Dairy is pretty bad for your allergies as well. It might actually help you to switch to a substitute.
False	I might try it next time i go to the store
False	It would be a wise decision. So what else do you like to do in your free time?
True	play online games,you?
True	I am an amateur painter. I try to get my boyfriend into it but he isn't really a fan.
True	He bought tickets to a fundraising raffle. I never have that kind of luck!

True	It was a youth sports fundraiser. 
True	that's a good cause!  My friend and I played a gig recently in front of a group of people that were in a football team.  
False	You're in a band? How fun!  Do you play, sing or both? 
True	I wish I could sing!  If only!  I actually play the drums.  My bestfriend is on bass.  I love it!
True	I used to be a server at red lobster. Endless shrimp was the reason why I quit :) haha
True	man i LOVE shrimp! I have ever since I was young enough to remember
False	Thats awesome. Shrimp really is delicious. Right now it's only $15.99 for all the shrimp you can eat. THAT IS RIDICULOUS
True	true ! i was raised near the ocean so i really love seafood. I tend to eat more than I should sometimes. It can get expensive 
False	I love it too but not as much as I love playing guitar. Do you ever play guitar?
True	sadly not since high school but i do guitar when i have time to myself
False	That is fun! Do you have any animals? 
False	Yes, I have a small Boston Terrier, Ollie. He's 12 years old, but still thinks he is invincible when trying to run after cats on his leash.
False	Haha thats funny. I have a dog and two cats. My cats always gang up on my boxer. It is hilarious. 
False	I love boxers, and their cut off tails. Ollie's is the same way! I have outside cats, but they tend to stay away until Ollie's inside. 
False	I go to the gym every day, but never go running. Does it help you stay healthy?
False	It certainly does!
False	I might try it out. Do you eat healthy as well? 
False	I think so, lot's of organic, but enjoy some treats too. you?
False	I cook most meals for myself, but admittedly could use more veggies! I want to live a healthy lifestyle 
False	it's not always easy. luckily, we've a lot of forest running trails. super relaxing all the green .
True	Nice, I'm also near the forest and the weather has been beautiful, kind of cold though. Is it warm where you are?
True	it's getting colder! but i'm from a nordic country, we love being outdoors in all weathers.
False	i'm sure she likes you more than you think
True	Yes, I agree with you on that but and she loves me regardless.
False	that's really nice to hear. i have 2 cats and a dog as well.
True	Oh wow do you. Do you have to chase after them at all? I can't do pets I hate running lol.
False	my cats are pretty lazy but my dog is high energy and i take him on at least 2 walks a day for 30 minutes each
True	Lol that sounds like a cat to me, lazy. Yes, high energy well I hate doing too much. I'd rather watch basketball.
False	basketball is a fun game to watch.
False	Agreed, I am obsessed with it and it's one of the best sports created. What's your favorite?
False	mine would have to be football
False	Ooooh, football is a good one. It's a great one for sure. Who's your favorite team?
False	I hope so! I'm sure you'd enjoy it. What do you like to do for fun?
True	My favorite activity is walking around the park, as boring as it sounds. I also enjoy making wedding cakes.
False	That sounds like a lot of fun, I bet you get to be really creative
True	It's one of the only places I get to let my creativity flow. I haven't found any other outlet yet.
True	Have you tried games? I like playing d&d, it's a fun way to connect
False	I've always wanted to try getting into D&D, but I could never find the opportunity to get started
False	Sometimes local game shops will hold open nights! There's a thing called the Adventurer's League, they host open games for beginners and often have listings online
False	That sounds great! I should look into it soon.
False	definitely, it's a fun way to get out of the house and meet other people!
False	Definitely need to get into something new. I should try to make time.
False	We do, but we get competitive sometimes. 
True	Sometimes sibling rivalry dies hard -- even when you've well outgrown it. Are y'all far apart in age?
True	I'm 5 years older 
True	That's pretty close! Do you guys play football? It's my favorite.
True	we don't, but i love football too. 
False	It's a lot of fun. I play quarterback.
False	what's your favorite team? Mine is the Saints
True	I liked watching the Saints win Superbowl XLIV. I like The Chicago Bears.
True	I think we may go back this year 
False	We'll see. It's looking like a good year for a lot of teams.
