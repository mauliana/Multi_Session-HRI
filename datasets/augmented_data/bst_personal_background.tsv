No	You sound like an animal lover too.  Any pets?
No	I do love animals. We currently have a dog and a cat. How about you? Did you ever get another rabbit?
Yes	Same on the dog and cat.  The dog was a stray named Blue.  The cat is a rescue named Smores. No more rabbits, for now.
No	We found our cat at the park one day, she was a skinny little kitten. She has been the best pet!
No	Awe!  I bet she is sweet.  What is her name?  What color is she?
No	She is black and her name is Moon. I never had a cat growing up but they really are so easy to care for.
No	Now Moon is the coolest name for a cat.  It's really unique, especially for this time of year. They are easy.  
Yes	No more pets for us for a while. We live on a lake so we get to see plenty of wild life around here, that's enough for me.
No	I bet it's beautiful.  I have always wanted to live on the water.  What area - if you don't mind me asking?
Yes	We live in the Midwest, it is beautiful here. I don't ever think about leaving.
No	I want her to still be my little panda,thats what i call her because i love them so much.lol
No	Haha! That is so cute!
Yes	i remember when she was a baby just sitty on the beach ready books.They grow so fast.
Yes	They do grow up quick.
No	I just hope she makes the right decisions in life.
No	I hope so too. 
No	The world is a different place now
No	It definitely is.
No	I live on the beach so when i relax i loving reading there,but now all these kids are rowdy,so i stay in
Yes	I wish I lived near the beach. 
Yes	It's been so long since I've had a good seafood boil. At the bar, we just have the cocktail shrimp.
Yes	Some people are allergic to seafood
No	I know, it's so unfortunate! I couldn't imagine life without crab legs and mussels.
No	I donâ€™t think i could eat something with legs everywhere!
No	Are you a vegetarian?
No	No i eat animals, but not ones that come out of the sea... four legs is ok but eight?
Yes	Haha! I totally understand. What's your favorite dish?
No	I like pizza, but not with shellfish on, it brings me out in a rash! What is your favourite dish?
No	I can always go for a good pasta dish. I made some Thai basil zucchini noodles and they were delicious!
No	They sound delicious! Are you a vegetarian?
No	Cycle of life. But it would just be helpful. Therefore, I wouldn't be sitting around waiting, hoping, expecting.
No	It would be helpful. How hard is it for them to make a personal message you know. We took the time to fill out the application you know. 
No	Exactly! Have you had this experience lately or been in a long-term situation?
No	I recently got a rejection letter that was really vague and unhelpful from a company. 
Yes	Well, I've been reading self-help books, lately. Working on me, how to write a winning resume, make them notice you, type of thing. I figure it's good for life.
Yes	Yeah, I think self help books can be helpful in every avenue. Which one are you reading?
Yes	Resume help for dummies. Enough about me. I hate to be a complainer - thank you for letting me share that and get it off of my shoulders. :-D
No	No problem. Its healthy to vent and tell people things that are bothering you. 
No	What are you into? what are you up to, lately? Read any good books?
No	I enjoy drawing and I havent found any good books lately but I am into Gillian Flynn and love her writing. 
No	Yep.. they actually used to be called ORVs.. (I learned that from Goonies)
No	Well I didn't know that but i like that film! I'v seen it a million times.
Yes	Me too.  We actually were in a heavily modified SUV Land Rover last year in Africa on Safari
No	Oh wow! I've always wanted to do that. Would be nice to see powerful animals outside of a zoo!
Yes	It was an amazing experience.. we were on a hunting / conservation trip so I actually got to shoot a lion (for a good cause)
No	That makes for a good story! Don't know if i could do that though, can barely kill a spider
No	Yeah, it was definitely an interesting experience.  When I got back home, I built a small clay diorama of the experience (I do clay modeling)
No	That sounds like a fun project! I took a pottery class once but one of my dogs knocked my masterpiece over soon after I brought it home. 
Yes	Aww, that stinks.  Dogs are awesome pets but they can definitely be a bit clumsy.  But yes, clay sculpting is a lot of fun and very therapeutic.
Yes	They definitely can be! I have three so can be a bit hectic at times. Should definitely show me some of your work sometime.
No	tell me more about it
No	they eat a lot of crickets and dubia roaches, also there are 40 different families of them
Yes	can you name some of them
Yes	Komodo Dragon, Mexican Beaded Lizard, and the Gila Monster
No	that is awesome I wish I could go see them
No	you can at many zoos and even just in the wildlife you can get lucky and find a few
No	I may go this weekend with the family 
No	go during the day that is when they are most active
Yes	I will do that thanks for the advice
Yes	you are welcome, any kind of animal or such you like?
Yes	what kind of clothing do you like?
Yes	I like dresses alot, especially the ones from American Eagle Outfitters
No	cool, do you like ones that have crazy prints?  that's the kind of clothing i like
No	I prefer the black ones that have zippers on the side and also a pair of pull on ones. I like to go out wearing pretty dresses to eat pizza.
No	pizza is great!  what's your favorite topping?
Yes	I like pepperoni the most! 
No	same here!
No	Yeah pepperoni is pretty good. Pizza is one of the most popular foods in the whole world. PIzza and shopping. You can't beat that combo.
No	no you certainly cant.
No	I can't wait to goto shopping in all these stylish stores. 
No	Yes, I am desperate for both me and him that it get approved. 
No	It's such a shame - the organisation that won the space race might be in jeopardy
No	Working in a doctors office helps with getting the correct information for my intolerance
No	Yeah. We should not consume more lactose as it has adverse effects on our body. 
No	Definitely!  What do you use an alternative to lactose?
No	Well, I always consume milk products in alternative to lactose. That works good for me.
Yes	Lactose is the sugar component of milk.  You should try banana milk; it's not that bad!
No	Of course I will love to try that. But it costs more I guess. What about the other alternative?
No	They have all sorts.  Banana, rice, soy, oat, coconut, cashew, almond,  lactose free, etc.  
No	Sounds great. I will try these too. How are you managing your diets with all these stuffs?
No	Carefully.  It's very time consuming, but not feeling sick makes it all worth it in the end.  I need my health to continue school. 
No	Yeah, its very vital for us to continue our life with fit and healthy. I will let you know once I tried this stuffs.
No	Why not, they make any dish so much better
No	I just don't know how to prepare them I guess.
No	You can always find fun ways to cook them on the internet
Yes	I suppose but I never learned to cook and I would just rather eat a burger.
No	I like to cook because I can save some money and still have a good meal.
No	I just buy frozen burger patties and throw them on the george forman. Just like my dad before he got locked up.
Yes	Do you just eat burgers or do you have anything with them
No	Usually a salad from a bag but I don't care for it.
No	I think if you branched out a bit you would find something you enjoy
No	Maybe, but who has that kind of time
No	Oh wow I've always dreamed of a restaurant, I love to cook especially for my family.
No	I love cooking. Thinking about becoming a chef. I love the way food brings people together.
Yes	I personally love cooking desserts the most. Good thing I have a dog so I can take him on long walks to walk all the calories off!
No	You are so right about that.  I like to eat and limiting calories I eat is quite difficult.
No	I agree, the best foods is the most calorie dense!
No	So true. I always eat it all. 
No	It's hard because my wife likes to split all the time
Yes	yes i believe it lol ! so what kind of food do you like ? i am craving italian !
No	I could really go for some pasta! I'm always craving pizza though lol
No	We just had pizza last night with the family. My kids love it!
No	You do? Who is your favorite artist?
Yes	I dont really play favorites. I like variety, since im actually a middle school art teacher
No	Awesome! I always loved Degas when I was younger since I took ballet.
Yes	I dont know much about ballet to be honest.
Yes	I danced for over 10 years, but it's not my favorite genre of dance. A great base, but too strict.
No	I suppose that makes sense. Also, the differences in dances around the world is something that intrigues me. So many cultures
No	The different cultural dances are so beautiful. I'm in love with Caribbean and Chinese styles of dance and stroytelling.
No	I also find Indian dance and Japanese dance fascinating. I love the different costumes and moves they use.
No	Yes, the costumes are so colorful!
No	I wonder what dance was like in ancient Egypt. Dance has existed for millennia, surely it existed then. 
No	What type should I start with? There are so many to choose from!
Yes	Well first you have to decide if you like brown or white rice or even just seaweed.
Yes	Hm, I've had seaweed salad before and enjoyed that! And I like white rice better than brown. 
Yes	The California roll is a great one for sushi! Classic!
No	I'll try that next tim! What other dinners would you suggest? I'll be at a sci-fi convention in the city and doing more dining out than normal.
No	Can't go wrong the sushi and steak special. A classic in Alaska.
No	Awesome! I was surprised that they have a convention in Alaska. Are you planning on going?
Yes	I wish! I hear it will it be an interesting and fun experience!
Yes	I think so! I always like seeing the different co-players even though I'd never be brave enough to dress up!
No	You should most certainly give it a try when you go ! If I could go I would dress up as Jade from Mortal Kombat! lol
Yes	I used to be in advertising, but I am a stay at home mom now.
No	Thats cool. I went to school for marketing. how do you like being a stay at home mom?
No	I am a people person, so it is certainly hard to not be working full time, but my girls are awesome so I have learned to love it
No	that's great to hear, how many children do you have?
No	Its and old Ford.   Where are you from?
No	I'm from Germany. What about you?
No	I'm from Mississippi.  I bet Germany is beautiful.  Do they have good food?  I love to cook.
No	The food is okay.  I do not enjoy cooking, I prefer eating.
No	I like that part the most.  Hows the weather there?
No	Not too bad. It is cold and rainy. I enjoy the weather
No	I love the snow.  I wish we had cooler weather here. 
Yes	We don't get much snow here maybe one good day.
No	Its hot in the south.
No	i would think it is too hot .
Yes	Do you like dogs
No	Yeah, I absolutely love them, how about you?
Yes	When you said you dyed it black for a role it reminded me of my favorite black dog
No	Ah, makes sense, is he or she still around today?
Yes	No, unfortunately he passed away while I was at work one day. 
Yes	I'm sorry to hear that, that must've been a rough thing to come home to.
Yes	Yeah, it was but I will always remember him. 
No	That's good at least, it's hard to forget them since they end up feeling so much like family.
Yes	Oh yeah that is for sure and because of my job I could not get back right away when he was sick
Yes	Yeah, it's tough balancing work and pets at times
Yes	I've been thinking about them a lot, especially on my long drive to and from work. They make me crazy.
Yes	how so?
Yes	They are hoarders. They hang on to everything. Going from the kitchen to the living room is like going through a junk yard!
Yes	do you live with them still? that sounds rough
No	My mom is disabled and my father is getting senile, so they live with me and my family. 
Yes	that has to be rough. props to you for stepping up like that. 
Yes	Thanks, as much as they drive me crazy, I don't want them to end up in a nursing home. It's just tough some days. What are your parents like?
Yes	Difficult. We don't see eye to eye on a lot, but they don't live with me so its easier
No	I understand. My dad and I don't agree about anything. Arguing is our favorite father/son activity lol
Yes	I try to put limits on it. Or make excuses to get off the phone.
Yes	oh, i'm doing a package tour
Yes	So, there's no hike included at all?
Yes	I'm hope so, probably as an additional excursion. 
Yes	Yah, more money, right?  I can't imagine being gone for that long.  My cats would miss me.
Yes	Always more money lol. If you wanted to travel, could a trusted person look after the cats?
No	Possibly.  I might be able to get someone to come stay with them, take care of the cats and the yard.
Yes	My mother does that for me, she also looks after my grandmother.  I'll miss them. 
Yes	How soon are you leaving?
Yes	Next month, so time to get all my ducks in order lol
Yes	Lots of time.  How is your grandmother doing?  Does she still watch The Voice every week?
No	I thnk people would wait in line to hear me sing
No	That is great! I am not a big fan of waiting in line. My patience
Yes	being patient is always a good thing.
Yes	I do hear that. I just have no patience for long lines and crowds
Yes	I understand just breath.  what about driving and road blocks
No	I also like to sing, it calms my anxiety. Road blocks, hmmm traffic and road blocks really test me
Yes	sometimes I humm songs to myself just to keep calm. it does also help with depression
Yes	Nice, I do the same thing! We have something in common!
Yes	Great!
Yes	Now I am not so sure my voice is line ready lol
Yes	Texas. Where are you from? 
Yes	Alabama, I have lived here my whole life. I have family in Texas and stayed there for a summer many years ago.
No	You know how hot summers are here then. Im just glad its getting close to Christmas. I love it!
Yes	Yes! Even hotter than here and Florida. I prefer cold weather, would love to move more north in the future.
No	My daughter loves the hot weather. Is it humid in Alabama?
Yes	Very humid. I loved going to Mount Rushmore and seeing how it was 97 but I barely broke a sweat. Dry heat was great.
Yes	I agree. Dry heat is much better than humidity. Not too humid in my part of the state though
Yes	That's good. The heat outside makes me glad that I work mostly from home lol.
No	Me too! I love a fire in my fireplace while I work. Cant beat it!
Yes	That makes me imagine a fire crackling. Very relaxing. Now I feel cozy and ready for bed. Where is the hot cocoa?
No	Good old Heinz, so regular. What's mushroom ketchup?
No	It's fermented napa cabbage, a Korean dish.
No	Hmm, what's it taste like?
No	It is not the most pleasant dish, let me just put it that way haha
Yes	Haha okay, so are you gonna make meatloaf soon?
No	I probably will. People make meatloaf with beef, pork, lamb, or even veal! So there's a lot of approaches.
No	I have only ever made it with beef. What way do you like best>
No	I like to be unconventional and use lamb, pork, or veal instead of ground beef.
Yes	Interesting, maybe the kids would be interested to try that sometime, do you have a recipe?
No	My grandmother had a great recipe. I think of her every time I have it now.
No	what other two dimensional mediums do you use?
Yes	Personally, I like to use graphite and charcoal to create grey-scale photorealistic images.
No	that sounds difficult.  what subjects do you draw?
No	I draw just about anything I mainly like drawing old buildings
No	do you draw from your imagination or use buildings as models?
Yes	i can do both ,its interesting using older buildings because you can see the different shapes of areas 
No	that sounds like it's fun.  do you use rulers or other tools to draw?
No	I usually just free hand it once you get the points of perspective you are good to go , do you draw?
No	i draw the occasional stick figure or doodle.
No	hay that is a work of art no matter what it is, my mom worked in oil paints I think that is why I like to draw 
Yes	It could be that they are afraid of us.
No	Or they have visited and the government is just covering it up. 
No	Or they visited, saw what our government is like, and turned right around and went back home. Lol.
No	Hahaha! You're probably not wrong about that! 
Yes	I'm not sure I would ever want to participate in space travel if it ever became an option to the general public.
No	I agree. Who would even have the money for that?
No	Yes, I'm sure it would be a bit pricier than the average plane ticket.
No	Yep, and think about how long it would take to travel anywhere. 
Yes	I guess we'll leave space travel to the astronauts and aliens.
No	I'll just stick to watching alien documentaries. 
Yes	I wish I didn't know that about you.
No	I cannot help of thinking of Bill Cosby when I think of pudding... So sad... Pudding is a great dessert or savory dish.
No	New topic. I love to make houses with nothing but matches.
No	oh , i like making houses with matches . have you ever tried ?
No	Yes, I just said I do. Are you listening to me?
No	I am listening, I promise
Yes	Do you like to travel?
No	Yes, I like to travel to distant geographical locations by train.
No	Where is your favorite place you've been?
No	Ireland, land of castles.
No	I go to a Catholic school in New England.
No	That's awesome.. I live in Colorado.. I also got my MBA out here in Denver.  Are you studying anything specific?
No	I am trying to get my Nursing degree
No	Nice.  My sister is a Nurse.. she really likes it :)
No	I love helping people and making them smile.
No	That's really important.. and, ESPECIALLY in the medical field, where that 'bedside manner' is a major factor in the healing process.
Yes	I hope to make a difference someday. Nursing school is very overwhelming at times! I hope i make it through
No	I'm sure you'll do fine.  Positive thoughts bring positive actions.  Just focus on your studies and you'll rock it :)
No	Thank you very much! I really needed that!
Yes	No problem at all, I think you'll do great.  School's a great experience if you make it fun.. otherwise, it drags :)
No	I feel like I am walking on sunshine from that moment. 
No	I believe it! I hope he made it perfect for you.
No	He did. He was nervous but gave this romantic speech about how I was the one and then got on one knee and I started crying.
No	That is very sweet. Will you have alcohol at your wedding? I've never had any.
No	I dont know yet. I havent started planning but I am putting together an pintrest page on what I want. 
No	Good idea. I love Pintrest. If I were getting married I'd love to bring my dog, she is my best friend!
No	He has this cute dog and we are thinking of making him the ring bearer. Wouldnt that be the cutest? 
No	That would be precious! What kind of dog is he?
No	He is a chocolate lab mix and his name is Oliver. What is your dog?
No	Aw! That is so cute! I think Oliver would make the perfect ring bearer! I have a white/brown pit mix named Reese. She has three legs!
No	No, I must have left it open when I went to work. 
No	do you have security cameras that you can check?
No	I do actually. I will check them later
No	I have a Ring, and I love it. 
No	I want to get one of those whenever I buy a new house soon. 
No	I am amazed at how much we use it, even to check for deliveries when we are at work. And the neighboorhood alerts are awesome
No	I love those videos where Ring doorbells capture people falling. 
No	I agree, and the ones where the delivery drivers throw temper tantrums. 
No	I havent seen those but they sound really funny. 
No	They get caught saying some pretty funny things, I wouldn't want to explain to my boss
No	What do you do for work?
No	I'm a nurse, on the night shift.. In my scrubs right now. Almost time to leave. You?
No	Im a football coach for the high school
Yes	Wow! that seems exciting. You get to prepare the next NFL players, and hopefully, have scouts come watch your team. Did you play ball in high school or college?
No	I played in high school, did you play at all?
Yes	No. Not at all. I'm a bookworm. Not athletic at all.
No	Oh haha, have you read the passage?
No	The passage, meaning book? No I have not heard of it. Who's the author? It's interesting that it is a title you recall so quickly. It must've been very intriguing.
No	Im not sure about the author, i just remember seeing it on tv and it was based on a book.
No	Oh interesting. I'm not the greatest with keeping up with books, lately. Did you think the book or show was better?
No	I do live in a big city, tons of people. However, I never feel closed in- I feel like the opportunists are boundless. Especially after graduating college. 
No	oh, wow! congratulations! what was your major?
No	My major was American literature and education. Aiming to make it big in the the big city. Where are you from?
Yes	nashville, tennessee! the great music city!  the population has boomed. it's like a little new york city.
Yes	That is a great city! I used to live up north in Kentucky. Always loved to visit the beautiful city of Nashville!
No	kentucky is beautiful country. lots of land.  do you miss kentucky?
No	Everyday, thats where my family lives. Is Nashville where you were born?
No	no. i was born in birmingham. i don't miss it, though.
No	Oh ok, also visited birmingham... Would much rather be in Nashville as well ;)
No	right! nashville is awesome. lots of opportunity.
No	Nope, 500 page novel for 5 hours
No	That sounds unnecessarily intense.
No	As intesnse as a panera bread can get
No	For me cooking is intense. I stay up all night cooking quite often.
No	Thats why you dont mix weed with adderall
No	I hear that stuff is bad for you.
No	You heard right
No	Sometimes the bad is the most fun, though. Unfortunately.
No	Thats why brown foods are delish
No	That's the truth.
No	Really, i am not heared about it
No	It's a really niche topic since it has recently gained a lot of negative reputation from its fanbase.
No	ok , can you elaborate more about techno ?
No	It's an electronically created music that really took off in Detroit, Michigan in the 1980's
No	ok, if it is a melodious music that why it gain negative reputation ?
Yes	Because the fans that enjoy it tend to be less appreciated by society due to their eclectic choices
No	ok ,you are fan of this music or not ?
Yes	Not exactly a fan, but I like to learn about all sorts of things.
No	ohh.. you are great person. I like to learn about animation related things
No	Animation is a fun topic! Do you do any animation yourself?
Yes	I do a lot of volunteer work with rescue dogs!
No	You sound like a very generous person. You got kids?
Yes	I do not yet, thankfully! I am a little young for that right now.
No	That's smart. I'm in school, work, and have a daughter.
Yes	I am in between classes in school right now and working to pay for them is stressful enough, I can't imagine doing this all with a daughter in tow!
No	Yeah, totally. She's three. Can't get enough attention.
No	I couldn't either at that age!
Yes	It's hard. I wish I could give her my whole day.
No	It's hard when you can't give someone the attention you want to, I have dealt with that myself, just not with children.
No	I bet you deal with it in your volunteer work, though.
Yes	I am fascinated with Greek culture because that is where my Mother is from. Do you travel often?
Yes	Yes it is a great culture, I do, every year 
Yes	I love to travel as much as possible. Have you ever been to India?
Yes	No, I have not, its in my bucket list
Yes	I have been there a few time. My Father is from India. I need to create a bucket list.
No	That is great, and yes you should I believe its easier to accomplish with goals 
Yes	First thing on my bucket list is travel to Germany for Oktoberfest. What are some other things on your bucket list? 
Yes	Great, next thing on my bucket list is to travel to Santorini Greece
Yes	That is a good idea. Very beautiful. Another bucket list for me is to play a zombie in a movie or TV show.
Yes	That sounds like fun, I had a friend that does extras in movies
No	Thats cool.  What is your favorite type of fish?
Yes	I've always been a sunfish man.
No	That's cool, I like the simple goldfish!
Yes	Goldfish bring back bittersweet memories of innocence and loss.
No	Really, why is that?
Yes	They are harmless creatures who wind up imprisoned in bowls. They give sad lessons on death.
Yes	That is very true.  I like fish in the ocean, mainly dolphins
Yes	The joy of catching sunfish is giving them a chance to be out of the ocean. In direct sunlight.
Yes	Exactly! I don't like people who fish and keep them to eat.  They belong in the ocean!
Yes	Then we must disagree, for I am a proud fisherman who loves nets and hooks.
Yes	i don't sew very well, so no, i don't sew much.  i like to work with clay.
Yes	The first thing I made in pottery class was supposed to be a mini cactus pot. I use it as an ashtray now lol
No	an ashtray is very functional.  i have many!
Yes	That's so true. That ashtray is 16 years old
Yes	do you take classes other than pottery?
Yes	no i haven't been in school for many years . how about you ?
Yes	no school for me either.  classes were hard for me to stay awake through
Yes	i hear that, i drank a lot of coffee while i attended classes and even that didn't help some days.
Yes	i wasn't able to make it through a full semester of college.  did you go to college?
Yes	I did attend college, but I am one of those statistics you hear about....a dropout. I just preferred to be at home baking or sewing instead.
No	Hey! its good to know you. Have you ever been to Paris before?
No	I have never been to Paris. A friend just came back and said it was a great experience.
No	So what are you plans for Paris visit?
No	I do plan to go to Paris within the next five years. I am putting aside some vacation money to do that with my husband.
No	I never been to Paris before but my folks visited Paris and said it is very very expensive.
No	Quite expensive, that is why I have to save my money for a few years before taking that trip.
No	Good move, Though I have saved enough for the trip but not sure in case of emergency I can make it or not.
Yes	I hope you do get that chance to visit Paris. Maybe we can coordinate and visit at the same time. 
No	Oh why not. I am interested in visiting those specialized boutiques in Paris which arrange special ramp walk for even individual customers.
No	That sounds like a lot of fun. I can't wait.
Yes	when I have a tough decision to make I go for long walks on the beach
Yes	Sounds good, for me it was playing a guitar that gives pease of mind.
No	you play the guiter? I like pop music
No	On my younger years I played it more though, 
Yes	you need to keep it up if you enjoy it!
Yes	The only thing I enjoy is being a primarily a meat eater lol
No	I am a big bbq fan, great food all around
No	There's no denying that
No	I cant imagine anyone being a vegan
Yes	Me neither, I think its more like a status like Oh look at me I'm sparing the animals kinda thing
No	I spend so much cash going to a little Italian restaurant near my house. That have the best pasta!
No	do you cook?
No	I love to cook, it has made me go bankrupt at one time, but now I cook almost daily!
No	do you cook italian food?
No	Oh, yes. I cook pasta a lot and my son loves to help me make homemade pizza. Do you cook Italian?
No	Yes, I love to cook! I have 4 sons, they rarely help me make anything.
No	Aww, it is a great family activity. We have a lot of fun and it makes my son feel like a big boy.
No	I bet, how old is he?
No	He is 5 and thinks he is 10. Haha1
No	Such a fun age. Is he your only one?
No	a couple more tickets and maybe a drink
No	gotcha, I could go for a drink,but it cuts into my gym time.
No	gym time is always a good place to go. i could use some of that myself
No	Maybe you could cycle to work.  It is an efficient mode of transportation, so you can workout while also being productive,
Yes	if it wasnt so far then i might think about it
No	Well a lot of places in the world use bikes as the primary form of transportation.  I guess they save a lot on gas
No	that they do, and i bet a few many are in good shape for that
No	certainly, many do not even wear helmets, which does not help
No	well that is being reckless, you need a helmet no telling what could happen
No	i did not think of that lol , i guess your right
No	Do you not like the cold weather there?
No	I do, I just don't want to be out in it. 
No	I would love to spend the day indoors reading. Whats your favorite genre?
No	Any genre fiction really, mainly sci-fi, horror and magical realism. How about you?
No	Psychological thrillers are my favorite!
Yes	I love psychological thrillers, any recommendations?
Yes	i havent read that one...maybe i will get a copy...i can certainly afford it.
No	It is a very interesting story. Have you read any other Dickens novels?
No	well the christmas carol...but i suppose everyone has read that :)
No	That is a classic. I love the updated film version with Bill Murray. Have you seen it?
No	yes, but call me old fashioned, George C Scott was my favorite Scrooge
No	True. That is the best version. George C Scott is a great actor. He brought the character to life.
No	sometimes i compare my kids to scrooge...not what i thought they would be!
No	Kids can be a handful. How old are they?

No	very excited of course

No	i somehow enjoy it.
Yes	I enjoy it too.  I prefer to photograph landscapes.  Tons of options near my home.

Yes	Awesome! My favorite subject in school was science!
Yes	History is one my favorites as well!
Yes	I really enjoyed history too. But science was always intriguing to me.

Yes	Agreed. I actually wanted to be a paleontologist as a kid as a matter of fact.
No	Some of the first Trex fossils were found in Montana and Wyoming in the early 1900's.  I'd really like to go on a dinosaur dig one day.
Yes	Same here. I've actually found fossilized dino poop on a dig for native American artifacts once.
No	That is quite an odd find.  Where were you at?

Yes	I do! I love calla lilies. My wedding bouquet was pink calla lilies
No	Your bouquet sounds lovely. What time of year did you get married?
Yes	It was in the spring. It had been raining every day but we were lucky and it was the only day that week that it didn't rain!
No	I recently went to a wedding in the middle of a thunderstorm. I felt so bad for the bride!
No	Oh my gosh. Was it an outdoor wedding?
No	It was indoors, but the reception was at a different venue than the wedding so the wedding party and all the guests had to be out in the storm
No	That would be very unpleasant
No	It wasn't ideal. But the rest of the day was lovely. Happy couple, good food, good dancing

No	I love to fish. I also like fishing to reduce invasive species. They are a danger to our ecosystem.
No	Yes, that is correct, well you do what you like plus you benefit the environment,
No	It is important to help the environment. And it takes my mind off of my internship. It can be stressful.

No	Yes, it is hard work, but there are so many rewards.
No	Yeah. like feeling productive and useful.
No	Exactly! Plus, I get to meet so many people and know that I am providing a place for them to relax and enjoy a quality meal. 
No	My wife is the same way.
Yes	Does she also manage a restaurant? 
No	Yes! Italian cuisine. Family-oriented.
No	That must be so rewarding!  Nothing brings people together like a good meal!  It's not always easy work, but it's also nice knowing we make people happy!
No	My wife feels the same. I'm more of a loner. A misanthrope, even.
No	i have read 3 of the game of thrones books.  do you like to read?
No	I do read occasionally, do you?

No	the movies are okay , but the books are so much better .
No	i agree.  much more detail and better written
No	They always seem to cut the most important scenes from the book too!
No	yes they do and i think it is because of the ratings and censorship for the movies

No	My favorite author is Anne Rice!
No	They are real wool and great quality. They are pricey but last a long time.
Yes	i bet you can make nice things from their wool,it could give some fittings

Yes	Yeah I didn't think about that,its good you suggested that, Could see some benefit there..
No	Do you own any wool items?
No	quite a few pairs ,my shirts a made of wool, how about you ?
Yes	I have some wool coats and gloves. I work as a cab driver and it can get quite chilly. 
Yes	Interesting!That sounds like it could be pretty uncomfortable to have to wear every day?
Yes	It's more uncomfortable to be cold!
Yes	i suppose that's a plus if you like feeling cozy ! Neither are pretty comfortable,but one just had to cope.
No	It seems like it! I always love vacationing. Do you ever go on vacation?
No	No, but we are going on a cruise to Cozumel next Spring Break and I think that would be so much fun. Have you ever been?

No	I've heard that this diet is very effective in helping to lose weight.  You've proved it.
Yes	Its incredibly healthy. Although, the start of the diet is a little bumpy because you have to go through whats called a 'Keto Flu'.
Yes	That doesn't sound nice! Have you recovered from the Keto Flu yet?
Yes	Oh yeah, it lasts about a week or less. I've been on the diet for months now.
Yes	I admire your discipline.  Although, try not to overdo it with the weight loss.
Yes	The weight loss doesnt go too far on the diet anyway. Just gets rid of the weight you really dont need
Yes	There's nothing I love more than a doughnut after I've been in the studio.  Not sure I could keep it up for months like you!
No	Ill never deviate from my Apple, I love it as much as I love summer and mexican food! Ole!
Yes	I always need my cell phone I have to use it for work apple is a good product as well. 
Yes	I have all Apple everything, so it's convenient.  Just need to convert my girl...for her its like a new religion

No	The good news is the chances of actually getting HIV is relatively low. You should not have to worry about it.
Yes	I hope you are right! I'm still freaked a bit though. 
No	I would be too. You should talk to her about the cheating and also make her understand how worried you are
Yes	I don't know what to say to her. She has a way of making it all about me. Like I shouldn't have looked at her phone.
No	Well trust is earned. she shouldnt give you reason to doubt her
Yes	I thought I was being paranoid. I don't trust easily. This just screwed me up more. I will try man. Thanks
No	regardless of what she says about you checking phone, fact remains you were right and she cheated. you deserve better
Yes	Everyone tells me that. Maybe you all are right. Regardless of the test outcome. I need to take a good look at myself.
No	I agree, but worry about one thing at a time. get through the test results, then worry about you, then relationship, but concentrate on you first and foremost
No	did you know that Prince is one of the best guitar players ever.
Yes	I did! He was a fantastic musician. Very innovative, very creative.

No	Definitely. Music lived in him that is for sure.
No	She could have at least said 'Happy Birthday' or SOMETHING. I can wait for the gift!
No	That is true. Maybe she just honestly forgot. I wouldn't take it personal though. She has alot on her right now with the death of her mother.
No	That's true. I want to be empathetic, but she's really hard to read these days.
Yes	I know this is a difficult time for both of you. Her grieving and you trying your best to shoulder alot of things she use to do.
No	I wish I could just get into her head and figure out exactly what she needs from me.
No	take care and spend time with her . we could all be gone tomorrow .
No	No kidding. Forget my birthday, I might just set up a nice evening for her.
No	You're so kind she will love that. And might be just what she needs to take her mind of everything going wrong right now.
Yes	Anything to keep a happy home. Happy wife, happy life, right?
No	exactly , i would have to agree with you . cherish every moment .
No	I am going to start yoga
No	Yoga huh? What made you decide to start that?
Yes	I feel I need it bad they say its good for your health , have you ever done yoga before ?
No	Can't say I have
No	It is not going to be to costly and if I don't like it I won't go any more its a class

No	I strongly agree, some of them really need the help. 
Yes	Yeah those two gals gave me quite the push to win in life!
Yes	My parents also raised me well and were always around, I feel bad for children who suffered from neglect due to various things like substance abuse, unemployment, etc.
No	you're right. I wish I had more time to help out kids in need like that. We should totally volunteer as big brothers!
No	Yes, that sounds like a great idea! I would totally be down to do something like that.
Yes	we just have to pick a date on when we're going sign up or else I'm gonna forget, honestly one of the few bad character traits that I have.
Yes	For sure. That's okay, that's what friends are for, to help you where you lack.
No	Lets pledge our friendship to the skies and get friendship rings to show the world that we are brothers!
Yes	That sounds awesome! Friends for life.

Yes	I have only flown into the Baltimore airport.  I have never spent time in the city.
No	Baltimore's Inner Harbor is a big tourist attraction. Lots to offer
Yes	I have been to the Boston harbor but not Baltimore's harbor, maybe it is similar.
No	Possibly so. What are you up to?
Yes	I'm trying to reach something on a high shelf but I'm too short.
No	Oh no that's no good grab a chair. 
No	I would but I'm afraid my dog will knock it over while I'm on it.
Yes	Oh wow what kind of dog do you have? I'm actually looking for dog training jobs right now.
No	I have a belgian malinois.
Yes	I like Belgian Malinois dogs. However, their ancestor species are extinct I hear. Kennel him until you are done with the chair.
No	Most likely but even Xanax and other anxiety drugs really help.
No	I have found that daily yoga and a strict vegetarian diet eliminate stress for me.
Yes	I agree but I do enjoy watching the birds on the weekend. What do you do for fun?
Yes	I wish I enjoyed watching birds. I wish I enjoyed doing anything.
Yes	I also like to read horror books. Do you read certain types of books?
Yes	I told you. Ever since I got fired from my job, I haven't enjoyed doing much of anything.
No	Im sorry to hear that. I hope things turn around for you.
Yes	I hope so. Deb was thinking about leaving me because of it.

Yes	Me too--i love the snow and i hate hot weather!
No	Tell me about it! So, what are you're hobbies?
Yes	I like skiing--I've done that since I was 5 years old, but haven't had much time recently.
Yes	Wow, that sounds awesome! How hard was it to learn?
No	My dad taught me when I was 5 so I don't totally remember, but I think the younger you are when you learn something the easier it is
No	That's what I've heard. I learned how to be anxious and sleep, haha!
No	heh, me too--I'm very good at both of those things now!  So what do you do for fun?
Yes	I like to play video games and try to write fantasy stories. How about you?
Yes	My too!  What are some of your favorite games?
Yes	I would love to have one in my garden this summer
No	How would you get a rotisserie chicken in your garden?
No	I mean, I would love to organize an outdoor lunch with my family
No	Ah, that makes more sense. Chicken would be great for a lunch with everyone!  What else would you have?
Yes	I would love to BBQ some Beef
No	BBQ beef and rotisserie chicken would be a good combination, it would give people options.  What side dishes would you have?
Yes	Salad and corn. I love cooking, I could do it for hours
Yes	I like cooking too!  It relaxes me as much as art does.  
No	Yes! The same here, it is my favourite hobby
Yes	I'm almost done with art school, I'll be happy when its over.  What type of art do you do?
Yes	I get to spend the weekend with my daughter, she loves shopping so I'm gonna spoil her silly!

Yes	Yeah? What kind of stuff did you buy?
No	I didn't buy much but did find some new clothes to wear to work. Are you looking to buy anything in particular this weekend?
No	That's good, as my wife says, you can never have enough clothes! But nothing too expensive hopefully, have to save for Christmas.
No	I can't believe Christmas is almost here. I don't start to think about it until after Thanksgiving.
No	I think about it all year round I really like Christmas time, especially when it snows.
No	It doesn't snow around where I live so it's hard to get in the Christmas mood with warmer weather
No	Well on the up side at least you don't have to shovel any of it when you can barely feel you're hands because of the cold!
No	Yes, it definitely has it's benefits!
No	I guess it's good it wasn't deodorant that I forgot.
Yes	Sometimes i wish i could just spend more days at home to avoid those kind of mistakes lol.
Yes	Funny, well I work in a lab where it is always cold so one thing I never forget to wear is long sleeves.
Yes	I see. What kind of lab work do you do?
No	A medical lab like where blood work etc is done. I'm also vegan.
No	That's cool. I'm in a band with my best friend.
Yes	Wow, do you get to travel a lot?
No	Yes always. I wish i could spend more time at home though
No	Well that is cool to be in a band. I like to sing and wish I could play an instrument.
Yes	What kind of music do you listen to?
No	That reminds me. We had to learn about the light spectrum recently. Frankly, I am no fan of that science stuff. Too much to wrap my head around
No	I am always curious to understand things. But some things are better left unknown.
Yes	I'm more of an artsy type person. When painting pictures, I try to use purple as much as possible in a way that looks pleasing, such as a late sunset
No	Lovely! In Europe and the US, purple is always associated with royalty, magic and mystery.
Yes	That is one of the many reasons I love purple. My main reason for loving the color is that it gives me a calming sensation
No	I love it because it's such a royal color. It makes me feel like a queen.
No	If there is anything I should buy that comes in purple, I buy the purple one
No	Why not? Purple is the best color to be associated with!
No	I totally agree! I honestly surprised how few people like purple
No	There are a bunch of people that really don't! Bold colors aren't for everyone.
No	The character's name. I cry every time I watch that movie. It's so timeless.
No	so is it a sad movie ?
No	In a way yes, it's very dramatic and it builds up throughout the movie. And the ending, wow.
Yes	ive never actually seen the whole thing i remember it playing on tv alot when i was a kid
Yes	I never saw it until four years ago but it was worth the wait! Another hobby of mine is playing around with clay models.
Yes	thats cool i play guitar what do you do with the models
No	Oh yeah? What kind of guitar do you like playing the most? I mostly like making pottery and using it around the house.
No	i used to be in a metal band but i play all sorts of styles now
No	That sounds awesome. I love listening to classic rock the most and a lot of that is hair metal.
No	we were more along the lines of thrash but hair metal ids definately a part of it
No	especially when I've entered a very productive streak
Yes	Absolutely. I hate getting thrown off. I am a very driven person.
No	Me too, I like the feeling of accomplishing something, from start to finish. That is its own reward.
Yes	I agree. I coach football and that's a message I tell my players.
No	That's awesome, I haven't played sports in a while but I've been thinking about volunteering for my local youth club, they currently need more referees
No	You should try it! Get some experience and you'd be more qualified than the NFL referees.
No	I'm really considering it, especially since I could take my kid there to get some quality playing time
No	You should do that! I'm sure your kid would love it. My brother used to referee at the youth club.
No	Cool, how flexible are the schedules? It's hard to balance things with my job and toddler
No	I would have to ask my brother. He still lives in my hometown, Syracuse.
No	nature can make you feel at peace
No	There is nothing better than a warm day with a glass of tea in one hand and a good book in the other
No	I can agree only if you add a good movie in that equasion
Yes	I like a good movie, but I love a good book. I love books so much I even work in a store that buys and sells sed books.
No	I have an older brother who works in a bookstore!
No	I hope he enjoys it as much as I do.
No	I work in bookstore as well, and i must say. He enjoys it much more than me. Don't mistaken me i love to read.
No	So what do you do with yourself?
No	I enjoy watching scary movies, reading thrillers, and relaxing 
No	Relaxing I can handle. I do not enjoy anything scary.
No	So messed up that I can't wait to see what happens next!
No	No kidding! Same
No	I listened to a podcast about the show and they seem to think the next episode will be a great one
No	I would love to listen to more podcasts especially while im out on my daily runs. 
No	That's the main time I listen as well
No	Awesome! I am also looking for a second job. Any clue on who is hiring?
No	I am pretty set in my current employment so I haven't looked recently. Have you tried zip recruiter or indeed?
No	Thats a really good idea. I havent yet... What do you do?
Yes	I am a sales manager at a local supplies company. What about you?
No	I do sales work! Its not paying the best but its at least paying my bills. Do you like your job?
Yes	My dad loved cryptic crosswords!  I remember finding them way too hard when I was younger--maybe I should try them again,
No	Definitely! You'll get addicted. It's like a workout for your brain!
Yes	I'll check them out.  I'd rather do those than anything math related, that's for sure!
No	I can't argue with that! I was never a huge fan of math.
Yes	I really hated math when I was in school--English was always my favorite.
Yes	My favorite class in school was always art. I love painting, drawing, and I would even crochet during my other classes.
No	That's awesome! Hey, speaking of painting, did you know it's Bob Ross' birthday today? 
No	I didn't know that! I loved watching his show when I was younger. So serene!
No	He was a truly exceptional human being.  His show was almost like engaging in meditation (and I'm not even artistic--I can't draw at all!).
No	I probably should have followed along with the show, but I just loved watching. 'Happy little trees' made for a good nap time.
Yes	Yeah, they stole both of my laptops
No	Oh no. That's scary. Are you ok?
Yes	Yeah, I think so.  It just is a little disappointing.  I have chocolate to keep me distracted.
No	Chocolate is a good distraction. What kind of chocolate do you have?
Yes	Hershey's.  It's okay, but I prefer Reese's. 
Yes	I love Reese's! Best chocolate ever!
No	Yeah! I just wish it wasn't so unhealthy.
No	I know. They have a lot of sugar free candy out now. I tried it. It's not so bad. 
Yes	Interesting... I will have to look into that.  I eat way more sugar than I know I need.
Yes	Don't feel bad. I do too. But I'll grab some sugar free candy from time to time. 
Yes	Yes, he did exceptionally, he join the soccer team
No	Awesome! Is he getting plenty of playing time?
Yes	Oh yes, he is getting plenty of playng time. 
No	Xbox? :)
Yes	I think my favorite path to run is through central park what about you?
Yes	I love it there, it is so calming and peaceful. Except when you end up stuck in traffic in Pigeon Forge. haha
No	Oh wow that seems like a very long run.. from NYC to TN
Yes	haha. I was referring to the gang of pigeon's in NY.
No	Oh I understand now! Yeah, but they are better than the geese
Yes	they can be a turn off for running in the parks, and make me consider running on the treadmill, but love the action of outdoors.
Yes	I do too it just isn't the same on the treadmill. You cant replace the feeling of the cool crisp NY air
Yes	Yeah, running in outdoors is more satisfying to me. So colorful. Fuels an artist's imagination.
Yes	Ahh so you are an artist! WHat is your preferred method of crafting?
Yes	a teacher, but I dabble on my own time, of course, on the canvas.
Yes	Personally I am not a big fan of all the humidity
Yes	Yes, neither are my cats! Their hair is so thick it can get unruly
Yes	Oh you have cats! Adorable! I love cats. My little black cat loves to sit outside and hunt lizards on the porch
Yes	That's adorable! I love my cats like they are my children.
No	I am the same way.
Yes	They enjoy it much better than where I grew up, in North Dakota.
Yes	North Dakota huh? I grew up in Canada actually, my dad is canadian.
No	That is cool! Everyone that comes from there is so tough when it comes to the cold.
Yes	I love the cold, its why i hate the heat so much
No	That is totally understandable
No	Do you collect anything?
Yes	no i don't collect anything. However, I am into traveling. I come from a big city. Which city did you find the antique store? I love treasure hunts. :-)
Yes	I went with one of my brothers to get a tattoo in Ponchatoula, we went into the antique store next to the tattoo shop.
Yes	i am so jealous!!! that sounds amazing. on a teacher's salary I don't get out of town often, but when I do...visit exotic, unheard of places-priority.
Yes	That's fun. I don't get to travel much either because I have two dogs I would have to board. 
No	awww I've always wanted a dog. I've only had cats, which I love, but you can't really bring them places. :-(
No	paris and switzerland...
No	that is so cool! omg beautiful.. what part of france?
No	what is your favorite place?
Yes	The Hyatt Place because it has a lit of different sights and museums.
No	good..i have never been there
Yes	Next time you're there check out the public transport.  The railway and bus system is very high tech.
No	sure will check..is food good in that place?
Yes	it is.. good .. big portions and a reasonable price
No	then i will plan for christmas
Yes	Yeah you definitely should, there is a lot of great restaurants as well.
Yes	No. I just tossed it. I couldn't risk my kids getting sick from any mold that may have gotten into the container.
No	yeah that was probaly for the best. 
No	I agree. Do you have any kids?
Yes	yeah two.  a boy and a girl.
Yes	I've got three. Twins with Aspergers and their older brother.
No	wow. they mustbe a handful at times. but bring a magical smile to your face at others.
Yes	Yeah it can be a challenge but kids are worth it.
Yes	i agree. i love to take my children swimming.
Yes	Mine don't like swimming, but we like going to the zoo a lot. Do you have an indoor pool to go to in the winter?
Yes	nah, i live in the tropics, we dont really have a winter. whats there favorite animal to see? 
Yes	My two best friends
Yes	That's cool! Do you play basketball frequently?
Yes	I do about 2 times a week
No	Thats awesome!
No	What do you do for fun?
Yes	I like to read
No	Who is your favorite author?
Yes	Karen Marie Moning, Her fever series is my absolute favorite! Do you read?
Yes	I do. My favorite author is Stephen King.
Yes	Awesome! I have read a few of his books, they are good
Yes	Wait. Is that seriously his name? I thought it was legit Bruno Mars.
No	Lol, well isnt his BIRTH name but it was one his parents used a child for him.
No	Dang, you're right. I looked it up on Wikipedia. Didn't know that. Learn something new everyday I guess. Hah
No	lol TRUTH!, I think the MAIN buzz is the fact he Hispanice by origin, born in Hawaii and raised in LA. crazy childhood.
No	That's crazy for sure. It must be nice to be born in Hawaii though. Don't think I'd ever be able to leave. 
Yes	Oh you would. I was stationed there in the Navy. Keep in mind it keeps filling with people and there is nowhere for them to expand to.
No	I don't think that's so bad. Eventually the main island could be like a little Manhattan with an ocean side paradise surrounding it. Could be kinda cool.
No	Beautiful place for sure don't get me wrong. Fun fact did you know that Bruno got his start as a song writer? 
No	Makes sense. Most singers usually write their own stuff starting out. Usually it's not very good though, hence the switch to pros when they get bigger.
No	He had no backing and realized that he could get money ghost writing. 2010 he wrote a song for BOB and the lable wanted him to sing it
Yes	What is your favorite type of burrito?
Yes	My favorite is a beef burrito with a lot of guacamole, and cheese.
Yes	Same here! I love Taco bell, I used to go often when I travel with my band
Yes	I used to go to Taco Bell a lot but now I prefer the local shops. What kind of music did your band played ?
Yes	We played pop punk and indie mostly. Sometimes it was a little heavier. What is your favorite band?
Yes	My favorites are Rolling Stones and Police. 
Yes	My favorite band is The Story So Far, but I really like the Rolling Stones too. Rush is my other favorite band.
No	The Story So Far ! I need to check that out. Rush is very good too ! Do you like any other kind of entert
Yes	I like going to movies when I have the time, especially horror.
Yes	Horror movies are appropriate for this week. What is your favorite horror movie ?
No	I felt the need to inform others about the scandal and what was going on. I love to gossip, it keeps me on my toes
No	It is good to stay informed.
Yes	It is one of my quirks along with people saying I am OCD with staying organized all the time
Yes	it's not a bad thing to be organised, I have to be, I'm a carpenter
Yes	What an awesome field to be in, I believe you all are so gifted with your hands
Yes	I used to work in a pub, so glad i escaped to follow my dreams
No	I am sure you heard the gossip that I love to hear while working there
No	OF course I have.
No	I think since its raining today I will organize my closet, make use of my hands today like you. 
No	sounds like a good idea, it's horrible out there!
No	Is it still growing today?
Yes	yes , especially in the club scene in atlanta and music festivals . i like to party
Yes	Do you go to clubs alot?
Yes	i make a good amount , yes . nightclubs and concerts . how about you ?
Yes	On the weekend i go out with friends.
Yes	What type of clubs do you go to?
Yes	dance clubs. We 2 step a lot. i love going to eat eggs and bacon for breakfast after the club.
Yes	That's the perfect combination of activities
No	Do you dance?
Yes	Yes it's  great cardio
No	No way. Do you watch it very often?
Yes	I've actually been waiting to binge watch several at once.
Yes	That's the best way to watch a series.  I like to watch shows while I'm walking on the treadmill.  Takes my mind off exercise.
Yes	And it also keeps you from having to wait till the next week to see what happens. Karate is good exercise. Have you ever tried it?
Yes	No, I haven't.  Do you practice karate?  It looks like fun. 
Yes	I am a black belt. I'm thinking about becoming an instructor but I'm not sure whether I'd be good at it.
Yes	Wow.  I'm impressed.  You should go for it.  You never know until you try. 
Yes	Well, maybe I will. Do you have any dreams to do something new and exciting?
Yes	Next on my horizon is retirement.  I have 4 more years of working.  Not sure what I'll do then.
Yes	Retirement sounds exciting to me. I bet you're looking forward to having time you can spend however you like.
Yes	No note, they don't want me to know who they are. I will have to use my own insurance to get it fixed.
Yes	That's a shame. I had a situation where my dogs scratched my car and I need to pay to fix it myself
Yes	I guess these things happen to all of us from time to time. Maybe I'll ask one of my 4000 Facebook friends for recommendations for a good body shop.
Yes	Wow that's a lot. I'm sure you'll receive great recommendations. I am studying astronomy, but I don't know much about cars
No	That is great maybe I should tell my son
No	You should definitely consider it.  They are good with kids, but keep in mind, they typically have a thick coat that sheds frequently.
No	Armilldillos are like wart hogs and an cross between ant eaters.
No	Like those scrawny penguins? That would make me want to bench press a polar bear. !
No	I love animals but raw power of watching them chase people.. and the hype
No	Zoom, zoom. They need to keep up with me and try my super armadillo recipe. Hope they are ok, and not too weak.
No	i used to be able to walk to her home, but i have to drive over an hour now
No	that's a long drive may be she miss you too
Yes	we have been friends for many years and have competed in 5k walks together
No	that is very impressive you should visit her..
Yes	i hope my honda civic will make it to see her
No	drive safely dont overspeed in eager to see her
No	thank you.  i just found out that my boyfriend is flying her and i on a surprise trip together!
No	wow that's amazing ....have a nice trip and enjoy together
No	thank you.  do you like to walk for fun or health reasons?
No	i like to do if i have a company ...i like to talk and walk
No	I like to eat too thats why I walk twice a day
Yes	"Walking is good!  I used to run, or ""jog"" some years ago.  I try to ride a bicycle as regularly as I can these days."
No	Riding a bike is great exercise!
No	"Indeed, and fun, but I say every trip I go on is ""uphill both ways"", lol."
No	haha feels that way walking some days too. what else do you enjoy doing?
Yes	My first passion is flying RC aircraft.  Planes, helicopters and recently fpv quadcopters.
No	That sounds like a fun hobby. I paint airplanes and helicopters sometimes. 
No	Cool!  Wish I could paint!  I like music as well and am currently building a Cigar Box Guitar.
No	Anyone can paint! You should try it. Do you play the guitar?
No	I play some, mostly I make up my own tunes.  Not good at figuring out popular tunes to cover.
Yes	i'm actually a college student
Yes	I'm a first year student myself. Huge fan of Harry Potter (the books specifcially)! What's your favorite book to read?
Yes	Awesome. My favorite book is The Citadel, it's a novel centered around medical ethics.
No	I've never heard of it myself but it sounds interesting for sure. What are you majoring in?
Yes	I'm majoring in Computer Science, you?
Yes	Business administration management. I was originally looking to study the field of virtual reality but figured this business admin may be a little more secured in terms of job availability.
No	Ohh. Virtual reality is amazing and will be huge in the future but I understand your decision.
No	 agree completely but it still needs to be more mainstream for that to happen I feel. Not enough people are adopting it into their daily lives right now.
No	That
No	What made you want to get into computer science?
No	so what is your favorite band?
Yes	I think Metallica is one of my favorites.
No	Oh I see, Well I'm into more upbeat music, like pop, or rap something that helps me set a good pace when I go running.
No	Metallica can actually be pretty upbeat. But yea rap is also good for exercise.
No	if I were to listen to a Metallica song to add my playlist which one would you reccomend? 
No	Master of puppets 100%. It's a classic and very good to run to.
No	ok , awesome! Thank you . I will defintley be checking it out. I am always looking for new music to add.
No	Sweet. What's your favorite meal to eat? I always love chicken and rice.
Yes	I actually like sea food. so Crab legs, sushi, ,fish. things like that
No	That sounds delicious. I'm more of a chicken guy but the sushi from japan specifically looks so good
No	That's a shame. What else do you enjoy doing? Do you swim?
No	Swimming is really fun and besides it, it is very healthy as it involves all muscles of the body to be engaged in movement I have a swimming pool
Yes	I agree, I begun swimming when I was young. I like to think I'm fit!
Yes	With my job it can be difficult sometimes to find time for swimming and my two pit bulls
No	That's fair. What are the pit bull's names?
Yes	Lucy, and Jade - Jade has beautiful blue eyes and lucys are brown
Yes	Blue is my second favorite color besides purple. How old are they?
No	They are 13 and 10.  Thank you!
No	Do they ever go in your swimming pool?
Yes	Not really. They are more lazy than anything, but when they were younger, they did all the time
No	Very interesting, I'm glad I live where I do. 
No	It happened long time ago in India. Now it's changing
Yes	That is good to know, I used to work for someone who was born in India.
Yes	Oh, That's nice. I am from India. currently studying at Australia
No	Wow, I had no idea. How do you like Australia?
Yes	It's amazing. But, sometimes, I do miss India
No	I am sure you do, but you are getting a great experience that many of us wish we could have. 
No	oh Thank you, Where are you from?
Yes	From the USA, and I always dreamed of going to Australia. I heard they have some great fishing there. 
No	Yes, you should definitely visit Australia. 
Yes	Well, actually my husband wanted me to eat healthier, even though I think steak is healthy.
Yes	We eat steak at least once a week, but I know it isn't necessarily healthy.
Yes	It is filled with protein, so I believe it is good for you if you eat it once a week. 
Yes	Yes, but I know a vegetarian diet is so much better, the problem I would have is I don't like vegetables.
Yes	I love vegetables, they are great in salads or eaten as a side dish. 
Yes	I like salads, which is probably the only vegetables I really like.  But, I think the protein from meat is important too.
No	Yes, protein is very important for your health, and for building lean body mass. 
Yes	I live in the south where everything is fried!  At least I do grill almost all the meat I eat, including the steak.  
No	Fried food is not good for you. Grilling is a good way to go when cooking meat. Beans and yogurt are also a good source of protein.
Yes	Yogurt is okay, but I don't think I could eat enough beans to make up for the loss of proteins.  Have a good day!
No	Those are way harder to deal with than pets.
No	Yes they are sometime, but they are useful right now.
No	How so?
Yes	I am in a wheel chair, so they help me get around town.
Yes	Oh yes, I'm sure they are very helpful right now.  Someday I will probably wish I got along with people better than animals.
No	You are not a social type of person?
Yes	Not really.  I find it hard to relate to people.
No	Some people are pretty cool when you start knowing them.
Yes	It's just so hard to find a place to meet new people.
No	Think of your favorite hobby, and find a group interested in the same hobby as you in your city. Thats the best way.
Yes	Dogs are awesome!  We have a dog too.
No	Dogs are a lot of work for sure. Do you have hobbies?
Yes	I love making crafts.  I have had to set those aside since I've been on bed rest.
No	Oh. What are you on bed rest for? Surely some crafts can be done in bed!
Yes	I have another child on the way.  This one a bit more difficult, with a lot of morning sickness.
No	Oh wow. Congratulations. how far along? I hope you dont have Hyperemesis! Sorry you have been ill.
Yes	In my 2nd trimester.  My children are a big help.  My husband is going to buy some crafting supplies to keep us occupied.
No	Children are life's biggest blessing without a doubt. I am glad your family is big help! Family is everything
No	Thank you.  What kind of hobbies do you enjoy?
Yes	I enjoy surfing! I live right by the beach. And cooking, I'm vegetarian and make most of my meals from scratch.
No	WHen they come back I am refreshed and ready to enjoy them again.
No	Everyone needs to recharge every once in a while.  Children are terrific, but take a lot of energy,
No	Yes, when they are away I love to watch movies. My favorite movie is Pretty Woman. I also love to read.
No	I have gotten addicted to Netflix series Money Heist.  I binge watch.  
Yes	I love Netflix. I have not watched Money Heist. I am going to have to give it a try.
Yes	I am on the last season so will watch something else.  I only get to watch a little each afternoon.  
Yes	I enjoyed watching Mad Men. It was quite an interesting and historical series. 
Yes	 I might go to that one next. I am retired, which you think would give me plenty of time.
Yes	I am also retired, but busier than ever. Funny how you find things to fill your time and you wonder how you ever had time to go to work. 
Yes	I know, we bought a mini-farm when we retired.  There is always something to do.
Yes	Wow, that's amazing. One of those copies is mine lol
Yes	My boyfriend loves playing GTA as well he will spend hours on the game console playing.
Yes	That's awesome. Do you like playing with him?
Yes	Mostly.  He really has to guide me so I know what to do.  It's a very complex game.
Yes	It is! My partner doesn't mind watching me play but she gets so bored watching me play football haha
Yes	The game has been around since 2005, but I've only started playing recently.
Yes	Oh, nice. It's never too late to start! I've been gaming my whole life
Yes	I just have to make sure I take a break. They say sitting down too long is bad for you.
Yes	That's so true. I always try to do something physical between every game
Yes	I'm a big reader, so I spend a lot of time sitting down no matter what. 
Yes	I mainly like to read books written for young adults and children. 
Yes	reading books are great. i also love games that have a great story lore to them
Yes	What is your favorite game?
Yes	the final fantasy collection was one of my favorites along with the lore from world of warcraft. 
Yes	I'm not familiar with those.  Are they board games or video games?
No	Video games.
Yes	How often do you play video games?
Yes	a couple times a week and yourself?
Yes	I don't play video games.  I do like to play Candy Crush on my phone when I'm bored. 
No	still a game and i would consider video game as well. we all play some sort of game it seems
No	That is awful I am sorry to hear that. That must be hard, what will you do?
Yes	Im not sure! I may follow the work or try to relocate. Times are tough for sure.
Yes	That is for sure! It is a struggle feeding a family of 7! Our free time is spent visiting parks because they are free!
No	Thats a great point! Parks are always relaxing. Do you go to any national parks?
Yes	Yes, national parks are our favorite! We don't live very far from the Grand Canyon and go there camping often. 
Yes	Thats amazing! How much do the passes cost?
Yes	A vehicle pass is $35 which is great cause you can fill the whole vehicle! Great for a family of 7! Do you have a big family?
Yes	Not too big. Just 5 in total. I may move out near a park to try to get a job...
No	Fresh open air is always better than sitting behind a desk all day I would say. And there are always new things to see!
Yes	Thats very true. Life on a farm has me used to freedom, I dont think I could go back to something not as free.
No	Do you think they have monkeys in India?
No	I am not sure. I recently discovered that I love Indian food. Do you?
No	Sure, I love to go out to eat with a huge crowd, especially Indian food.
No	Yum! What do you do for fun! I like to play the violin. 
No	I like traveling and making new friends there. Do you play in a string quartet?
No	No, just for fun at home. where are you traveling next?
No	Africa, to see the gorillas in the mist.
No	Wow! That sounds awesome. I hope you have a great time. 
No	Thanks, I plan to! Where have you traveled?
No	My favorite place besides India is Italy. The pasta was so good!
No	Man, cafeteria pizza is like, the worst kind of pizza. I mean, I'll still eat it, but there's way better. Now cafeteria spaghetti and ematballs, yum
Yes	Oh no!  Cafeteria spaghetti and meatballs are so gross!  My Grandma's are so much better!  What is your Grandma's best meal?
Yes	She makes a mean lasagna. Does your grandma cook well?
Yes	The best!  And her lasagna is sooo good!  And her chicken parm, oh my!  Are you also in the band?
Yes	Not me, I wanted to try it out but I'd rather do drama more and couldn't fit both in my schedule
No	Oh you do drama, that is so cool!  Do you have a play coming up?
No	Yeah, we're going to do a Midsummer Night's Dream
No	Fun!  I'm sure it's going to be a great show!
No	I think the ticket's only like a buck, you should come see it!
No	Totally, I'd love to!
No	I miss those days. Now, both of my parents practice as lawyers for work.
No	That is important work though! I know they are doing great things
Yes	Oh no doubt. They love to argue though, maybe partly because of their job lol. I order everything on the internet and they worry about me getting scammed.
No	A completely valid thought, but it is way more convenient
No	What is your work? I work for the government actually and lots of my work is in secret.
Yes	I run a daycare close to Huntsville!
Yes	Alabama, huh? I work in Dothan, opposite side of the state. Small world.
Yes	It is a small world indeed. I love living there
Yes	I like it here but me and my family wanna move further north so we see snow every year and have four real seasons. It's so hot here.
No	Yeah it can seem like we are stuck in an eternal summer haha
No	You could always dance too
Yes	I love to dance especially to 80's rock music!  What is your favorite genre of music? 
Yes	I love rock music but like to dance to hip hop
Yes	Hip hop is awesome, very high energy! O love dancing to that as well.
No	Do you like to dance much>
Yes	Yes, I love to go out dancing with friends quite a bit.  How about you?
Yes	I love going out to dance but most of the time im in the studio practicing
No	What are you practicing?
No	Dance for recitals!
No	wow, that's very exciting! 
No	Thank you. My cat was pretty old for a cat, 20. She lived a good life.
No	She lived a long life for a cat but its never long enough for us who they leave behind. I hope you feel better soon...
No	So true. What breed of cats do you have?
Yes	I love black cats, and all of them really.  I think the manx cat is really cute, they have no tails.
Yes	My sister-in-law also loves manx cats. I think the hairless cats look kind of neat.
No	yes, you are right !
No	I suppose a plus to having a hairless cat would be not having to worry about the hair getting into everything.
No	very true . maybe i will have to get a cat too .
Yes	They sure do make for good pets, if you get one with a good temperament. I had one that only liked me when I fed him.
Yes	True, they are good human companions though. I actually tried to do that once, but my cat was not feeling that!
Yes	my puppy was 18 years old.  i don't think there is another that can take her place. she was beautiful.
No	Oh goodness, that has to be hard. 18 is a long life for a dog, but it never feels like it's long enough
No	$500.  that's a big win in my book. lol.
Yes	no kidding! I've never won anything more than another lottery ticket, haha
Yes	right.  the most i have ever won is another ticket.  i am not lucky when it comes to gambling.
Yes	Me neither, I'd rather spend my money on something I'll get something out of
No	right. like groceries, or gas for the car or household items.  those things add up.
No	they really do, budgeting is super important, and things like the lottery just don't make the cut most of the time
No	and if you really sit down and think about your odds of winning, that should be enough discouragement from playing. lol!
No	right! In order for one person to win, a whooooole lotta people have to lose
Yes	LOL! right! and i don't want to be the loser.  i like my belly and my gas tank full.
No	Same here :) it's just not worth the squeeze
Yes	I still do eat meat, I try to not eat as much but I need to make sure me and my family get the appropriate nutrition.
Yes	My daughter is thinking about that career track.  Is it hard though when an animal doesn't make it?
No	You just have to be able to adjust your training regime and look back at what went wrong and how you can improve.
No	Do you train any monkeys?
Yes	No, while I do some exotic animals, monkeys are not really in my wheel house! My wife does the more unusual animals for us.
No	Whats your favorite animal to train?
Yes	I enjoy training any service animals, they do such great work and live such happy lives.
No	They are very important and very cool
No	THank you! What do you do?
Yes	I'm a pizza delivery man.
No	Yeah, at-least his music will still be around for us to listen! 
No	true, true. the great legends never really die! do you like old country mostly or the newer stuff?
Yes	I like the older stuff, Charlie Daniels is one of my favourite artists. What about yourself ?
Yes	I love the old, sad country music, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings. I'm not up on current music though. I usually listen to podcasts or audiobooks in the car 
No	What audio books are you listening to at the moment? 
Yes	I just finished Education: A Memoir and trying to decide what to listen to next. Do you like audiobooks?
Yes	I haven't really tried listening to any. Call me old school but I like having the physical book in hand. Maybe look up something to do with country music? 
No	Lots of people do prefer hardcopy bound books, nothing wrong with that. I dislike driving, so it's a good safe distraction for me to have something to listen to
Yes	t is a safe distraction alright! I'm 23 and still haven't got my license yet. It gets pretty hard getting around in Tennessee. 
No	Oh I bet. How do you get around? You must live in a downtown area with lots to do within walking distance?
Yes	I listen to music when I'm at the gym, but when I'm home I like to read
Yes	When i am at home i like to eat large healthy servings and cardio to burn the calories
No	What do you like to eat?
Yes	I love some salad! But i also eat alot of un-necessary junk food. Fish and chicken I can live on
Yes	I can eat literal boatloads of brussel sprouts
Yes	I have tried brussel sprouts, they are not my favorite! I am more of a broccoli, carrot type of person
Yes	I love to cook! But boy do they stink up the house!
No	Too funny, I agree! What about exercising? 
Yes	Ah, nevermind that, I'd rather read comics and eat sprouts.
No	I have read a few comics! What would you recommend?
Yes	soap opera is alright, i am into a lot of different shows. not an actress though
No	That is ok, it isn't for everyone. What shows are you watching now?
Yes	various shows, ranging from the office to merlin
Yes	The office is my favorite show! My favorite character is Dwight
No	dwight is quite the character, love back and forth with him and jim
No	Yes he is. He and Angela were meant to be, in my opinion
No	i have to agree there. i would love a reboot or a where are they now season of the office
No	Oh I know! There are so many things they could make episodes about nowadays!
No	exactly! the fan base is there, they just need to do it already!
No	I couldn't agree more. Do you recommend any shows that are like the Office?
Yes	I would like to watch Netflix with my baby in my new sweater but its too small. 
Yes	Netflix is amazing!  Another show I love that just came back to Netflix in 2017 is Mystery Science Theater 3000.  Have you seen that?
No	No, I can't say that I have. Is it a crime series?
No	I'm not sure. I have only found it about 2 months ago. It's on the Syfy cable network. If you like Sifi or Horror films it's defiantly work watching.
Yes	I like both of those genres. I think I will check them out. 
No	i definitely recommend it . what do you like to do for fun ?
Yes	I like long walks on the beach. 
Yes	my favorite thing to do is shopping , but the beach is also fantastic !

No	you don't like Chinese food
Yes	no I do I just prefer Japanese food
No	please try to eat Chinese food....it's really amazing taste
No	I look forward too. what's your favorite chinese restaurant?
No	Is it worth keeping a dog?
Yes	I meant cats. Sorry my son is distracting me. I think having a dog is such a joy but a lot of work too.
Yes	I've never owned pets, but want to try new things, sounds like getting a dog maight be a good idea then
No	I'm glad to hear you want to adopt from the shelter. Saving a dog is so rewarding.
No	I sure hope so I want to do something that matters even if it is only in the life of a dog that needs a home
No	Consider adopting an adult dog. They are most often looked over at shelters and end up being put down. Plus they are usually more well behaved.
No	Thats a good idea! My main hesitation is the responsibility for another life, but an adult dog will probably be more self-sufficient than a puppy
No	yes and normally already potty trained!
Yes	That would be great since I will want a low maintainence breed of dog
No	I would suggest one with short hair so you do not have to deal with grooming. 
No	yea i am relieved, get to go surfing now!
Yes	That's cool! I'm interested in the culture of surfing. I love gardening so I'll be spending my day growing new flowers. 
No	what kind of flowers do you like to grow?
Yes	I love anything that you can put in the ground and watch it grow basically. My favorite though is roses and African Daisy.
No	thosesound like cool flowers, I cant grow much but love pandas
No	Pandas are quite fun, but it seems so strange that they only eat bamboo.
No	yea, maybe you should grow some in your garden!
No	Good idea! But the Pandas have to stay away lol. What are you going to school for? 
Yes	I want to go into business
Yes	Thats cool. I went to school for marketing so my next moves is investments and open some franchise businesses. 
No	Have you ever been blonde before?
Yes	No. I am 53 and from and live in Alabama
No	What color is your natural hair color?  I wouldn't go too drastic.
Yes	I am brown. No maybe some highlights.
No	I wouldn't go full blonde.  I think highlights would be nice. 
Yes	Yes I have a friend that highlights. I will probably go to the same stylist.
Yes	That can get expensive.  I color my hair to hide the gray.  I can't afford to highlight and get rid of gray :)
No	I know many people who get their hair dyed and do it themselves for a cost effective measure.
No	I've considered it, but I'm scared I would mess it up.
No	There is always a first time for everything. Just do it liek Nike says.
No	I'm not sure what all the traits are that are specific to Gemini.
Yes	I think you have some unique qualities to you!
Yes	I have work but i'm doing stuff on the side to make extra money. 
No	Nothing wrong with extra money.

No	already own a place and have no roommates, need drugs to keep me company 
Yes	Nice situation to have =)  What kind of drugs?
No	weed baby 
Yes	Ah, cool... that we have in common.  I was worried you meant something harder, and was going to suggest you get a cat for company :p
No	i have cats, 3 of them. one of them is a polydactyl and has extra thumbs
No	CUTE!  I love those extra thumbs.  I only have one cat, my roommate won't allow more.  She's a tabby.
Yes	I have not, what is it about?
No	It's about this dude locked away in jail that might be the devil
No	Wow, sounds scary.  I may have to check it out sometime!
No	I think it's a super fun but weird old movie. Avoid it if you don't like clowns though
Yes	Clowns? No thank you!
No	Yeah they generally freak me out too. So what do you do for a living?
Yes	I do work on my computer for companies.  It's kind of weird.  What about you?
No	I work as a server at a club. It's super stressful, but it pays well!
No	What kind of club? Like a jazz club or a night club?
No	It sort of changes depending on the night of the week, but I think you'd generally call it a dance club, caters more to younger people
Yes	Single and living alone.  I like to cook for my friends in my spare time.  Do you live alone?
No	I do and I never had time to go to college either because I had to run my familys farm.
Yes	A farm!?  I always wanted to live on a farm!  Do you enjoy it?
No	Most days. Its hard work! But very rewarding when you pull fresh vegetables out of the ground. 
No	Oh yes, the stuff at the supermarket does not compare.  There is a farmers market near where I swim.
No	Thank you for supporting your local farmers! Do you enjoy swimming?
No	I do.  I've been doing it for years.  I've gotten quite fast.  Do you like to swim?

Yes	Wow. A very noble major. Do you read novels by any chance?
No	at times when i can squeeze some reading in, but I am currently looking for something new to read. Any suggestions?
No	I recently read salvage the bones. It's a novel that follows an african american family as the prepared for hurricane katrina and also the aftermath
No	I will have to look for that one, I lived in Louisiana shortly after Katrina and would love to read anything related to that subject.
No	I'm also very interesting in american politics. particularly pertaining to the upcoming presidential election 
No	Hunt, mostly dove and turkey. Do you hunt?
No	Never, guns are banned in our country. Have you had any luck so far?
No	Got a few dove this season, It didnt really get cold enough for them to come south this year. 
No	That's an interesting fact I never heard about, how do doves even taste like?
No	Like dark meat chicken. They are good wrapped in bacon and grilled 
No	That sounds delicious, I am not even sure if they live in my part of the world
No	where are you from?
Yes	I am from Mongolia, what about you?
Yes	Im from Texas. 
No	That's a long way, is there any particular time to shoot doves, like early morning or is any time good?
No	They are so great I love to see them compete and the food be looking so good. 
No	I wish I could cook like that. They put me to shame.
No	Lol cooking isn't my lingo either so don't feel bad. I'm a singer so the only cooking I'm doing is on stage.
No	Well, that's another skill I don't have. Although I will say, my cooking is far better than my singing.

No	I love reading also mostly spiritual and self care books what kind do you prefer to read? 
Yes	High Fantasy. Wheel of Time, Dune, books like that.
No	It's music theory. I love the product but the whole theory thing is a struggle for me.
No	Is that a hard class? what is the idea of the class?
No	It's not so much difficult as it is tedious. It's basically the rules of music. It's a lot of term memorization and whatnot.
No	Oh wow ive never heard of the class but it sounds interesting. I love music but never had a in dept look into it
No	It is very interesting. I think I would find it more interesting if it wasn't such an early class! What are you up to tomrrow?
No	I will be volunteering tomorrow at the locl soup shop for the homeless
No	Wow! Look at you! That's wonderful. Doing it with anyone or just going it alone?
Yes	Im going alone but have made many friends there. Do you volunteer?
Yes	I used to but I haven't had the time in a while. Do y'all need the help?
No	We can always use extra help there. If you ever have free time you should stop by
No	why not?
No	depending on their age - you have to monitor what they watch - some are just so inappropriate
No	Yes, you are right. I prefer Youtube, I get to restrict the inappropriate content 
No	yes - easier to control
No	also it is full of cats videos!
No	I don't watch cat videos - but like the practical jokes ones

No	Oh man, free food! That's pretty hard to say no to.
Yes	I like pizza! What is your favorite?

Yes	I am from the South as well
No	So we have something in common.  Favorite color?  My eyes are blue, so I tend to like blue best.
Yes	Yes we do! I love purple. I like blue alot too, 
No	I've always heard that purple is a color we tend to like more as we age.  Is that true?
No	 I have always heard the same thing too! I think that may be something we hear South Lol. It may be true
No	Old wives tales maybe from the South.  LOL
No	Probably, fast food is just bad for you in general.
No	Yes that's true. You probably want to check out this organic diner across town. I heard that Kid Rock was last seen there. He is a delight.
No	Are they expensive?
Yes	No that expensive. It's slightly more than your usual chain restaurants but it's worth it. Are you tight on budget?
Yes	Yeah, I know the best way to save money is to buy groceries, but Im not a great cook.
Yes	Ah, well don't worry. Everyone starts somewhere. You can learn from online tutorials. This purple diner channel is a great start.

Yes	Yeah, the local grocery store is great, they tons of bogo's

No	yes, we were discussing cooking fish...and then....
No	Oh wow. So sorry about your fish.

Yes	I'm not a great cook.
Yes	I love to cook...italian and sea foods are my favorite :)
Yes	Awesome. I love sea food too! 
Yes	shrimp and pasta is good...seafood with italian...:)
Yes	Shrimp is the best. Especially with italian.
Yes	That's interesting. In my school district, 14-year-olds would be in high school. I do like the idea of having a broader mixture of ages, though.
Yes	I remember school details here cause it was when I got my start playing football. I play now for the Philadelphia Eagles, my second season.
Yes	Woah. Really? I grew up outside Philadelphia, in Cherry Hill, so you guys are still my home team!
Yes	Wow, small world! Yeah, last season I did not get a whole lot of playing time but now it's getting better.
No	Have you been with the team long? Where did you play college ball?
Yes	I went to college at Wake Forest. I'm excited to finally be getting more playing time and starting my career!
No	So what's it like playing on a professional team? 
Yes	It has its ups and downs like most things, but it's really rewarding to connect with fans and having them recognize you wherever you go.
No	Do you think about what you'd like to do later in life, after you're done playing? Would you like to get into coaching or something else?
No	As of now I can't see myself coaching. Would love to save up, start a family, and just travel the world with them. See lots of countries while we're young.
Yes	It's amazing how much talent is in the world! I can't believe how young some of them are!
No	yes , definitely very talented . what else do you enjoy ?
Yes	I enjoy garderning. I have a few rose bushes. They are a pain to take care of but so beautiful.
No	Did the plants grow up to be big and strong?
Yes	They definitely are! I have a few scrapes to prove it. They are not the easiet to make happy or take care of. Dang thorns! lol
No	I'm sorry to hear that! love gardening, it's so relaxing!
No	Oh it's worth it. I have the best ones on the block. I also have a veggy and herb garden as well. So you have a garden as well?

No	Not much, I am just happy
No	I'm happy for you! Everyone deserves to be excited about life.

No	What do you do for a living? Does that contribute to your happiness?
Yes	I make coffee. yes It does, I like making others happy with delicious coffee
Yes	I love coffee. I drink about 12 cups a day. Do you work in an office?

No	I don't know about Ireland having sheep dogs
Yes	What breed of dog is your favorite?  I like little ones, like Yorkiepoos.

Yes	Oh, big babies.  Do you have one?  I can't imagine not having a dog, even though mine gets under my feet while I'm cooking.
Yes	I don't have a dog currently
No	Wouldn't your kids like one?  I know mine enjoy ours.
Yes	I don't have kids. I ve always wanted to travel to puerto rico.
No	Now's a good time to travel -- no kids, no pets.

No	No, I find most of them on Facebook
No	Those facebook recipes make everything look so easy but a lot of them can be hard!  Any Facebook pages I can follow that have your favorite recipes?
Yes	I normally read what my friends post. Most of them love cooking 
No	That is awesome!  what else do you do to stay healthy?
Yes	I love running, I just run a Marathon. 
No	I think so, Iâ€™m not sure.
Yes	I was very close to my janitor in elementary school.  He was always very nice to me.
Yes	I wasnâ€™t, they never really talked much if Iâ€™m being honest
Yes	I didn't really get along with my classmates much, so he was a friendly man and kept the bad kids away from me.
No	Thatâ€™s pretty nice of him.
No	It was. He's always had my back.
No	You really need a friend in school. Could only image what kids these days go through
No	I think there is such polarization in the climate.  Some kids, especially special needs kids, are really just targets.
No	Yea, to make others feel powerful. Which is really unfair
No	Indeed, that's true.  I just worry what long-term effects it will have on some of them.  It's hard to concentrate on school when your mind is hurting.
No	Interesting. That's very helpful. Have you ever shopped at goodwill?
Yes	Of course yes!. I like them because  they are  retail establishments run by a charitable organization to raise money.
No	Yea. It's extremely affordable and you find so many neat items.
No	right ! it beats the high priced boutiques any day !
No	In-line with with doing things that are good for society i also think recycling is extremely important
No	very true . i feel very strongly about recycling .
No	Yea. It's terrible what plastic is doing to our oceans so i just want to do my part
No	iIts not just oceans but rivers,forests,lakes. Its really something that needs more attention.
No	Completely agree. Plastic bags from stores are a huge issue. I only use paper bags to carry things
No	Yes, that really helps but not everyone takes it as serious as us. If i couldi would just carry the items to my car everytime lol.
Yes	6th graders can be a bit challenging. I have been teaching for 12 years and I am ready for a change. 
No	Wow! Twelve years of teaching ANY age group would be challenging! 
Yes	I may try something more creative. I go to karaoke every Friday night and that is always the best part of my week. 
No	I didn't know you could sing! That's great! What kind of music do you like? 
Yes	I enjoy listening to dance type music, but I mostly sing 90's female alternative. What music are you into?
Yes	 I love so many types that it's hard for me to chose one. I guess it depends on the mood I am in. 
Yes	Yea, that's true for me too, but I don't have much of a taste for country music. What are you doing next Friday?
No	Country can be a bit much! I have to work. Maybe I should find a new job!
No	Ew, well if you get off early enough, maybe you can meet me at karaoke? If not this Friday, maybe another.
No	Thanks! And keep me posted on your job search.  I know that can be tough. 
No	Drums
Yes	Do you own you're own Drum kit or rent one?
Yes	Borrow. Instruments are really expensive. Do you play?
No	Sadly not since high school, but I do guitar when I have time to myself. 
Yes	Thats cool. What music do you like? 
Yes	I prefer rock or metal music. What about you?
No	I'm in medical school as well so I know how long the hours can be.
No	What field of medicine are you studying?
No	Pediatrics. But I also love theater as well and I do community theater on the side.
Yes	Ah cool! So you'll deal with children from birth through adolescence?
No	"Basically. Anything to help kids and their diseases. I feel as if that's my ""calling""."
Yes	Was there anything that made you want to become a pediatrician?
Yes	Well, I love kids and I was inspired by my own pediatrician as a kid. He was my role model growing up.
Yes	That is really cool.  how many years of school have you went through so far?
No	Only one thus far so I have a long road ahead of me to say the least. lol I'm at the University of Cincinnati.
No	aaaah, but it will all be worth it in the long run!
Yes	So true! But if all else fails, I do enjoy theater work as well so theater is always an option. Ha!
No	Were you forced to go into medical school?  It seems you really want to go into theater
Yes	That's interesting? Do you own a civic coupe?
No	No, I had to buy a much smaller car. I have a Spark.
Yes	I'm not familiar with that car. Do you like it?
No	Yes, I do like my Spark. It is super small, but fits in small parking spaces.
No	Cool! I like Honda cars. 
Yes	Do you drive a Honda?
No	Yes, I do! A Honda Civic. 
Yes	Cool, do you like older cars?
No	I do! My best friend collects vintage cars. 
No	Awesome. We have 2 old cars.
No	We have a few professionals, but most of us are amateurs with growing experience in theater.
Yes	Thats awesome, what kind of performance do you do?
No	Sometimes works by noted playwrights, but sometimes a historian in the community will bring a manuscript based on local events.
Yes	Oh that must be interesting, brining to life the history of your community. How long have you been doing it?
No	I just started with them a couple years ago.  School is so intense, it gave me a great outlet when I'm on break. 
No	Yeah, sounds like a good creative outlet. I don't think I would do well on stage, I'm fine in front of a camera. 
No	I find I have to concentrate on my lines so hard, I forget about the audience.
Yes	That's probably quite useful. I make videos and spend most of my time editing, I can make up one good read of a line from loads of takes.
Yes	That would be fascinating!  Do you have particular subjects for your videos?
No	It's a mix of general vlogs and tutorials, it's gaining some subscribers which is exciting.
No	wow, that's interesting.  I follow a vlog by a Swedish lady that moved back to her tiny village to create a life for herself.
No	I love that kind of thing, a window into a world you know nothing about.
No	We read the Bible. There is a lot of good information there.
Yes	Have you read Fantastic Mr. Fox? Such a great kids book. Really anything by Roald Dahl
Yes	I have not read it. What age group is it aimed at?
No	I would say 5-10. There's also a movie so that could be fun for the kids to know the story first and then see the movie as a fun activity
No	I may have to get it and read to the grandkids. IF I can find time as I am trying to get a law degree.
No	Well I'm sure you are doing plenty of reading on your own already. Maybe get them an audio book to put them to sleep XD
No	I prefer to read to and with them. NOTHNG is more important than people.
No	That's very good. I'd like to see more parents interacting with their children instead of plopping a phone in front of them
No	It is very disturbing the way all of society clings to their phones. I enjoy playing tennis to get away.
Yes	I've never tried tennis, but it looks fun. I enjoy running. 
Yes	Not really. I mostly work the farm and spend time with my wife and children.
No	That sounds like a nice balance. Do you enjoy your own work?
Yes	I love it. I live a simple life. What do you do for work
Yes	I work from home for a Poultry company. I do IT work, I enjoy it 
No	Working from home is great. 
Yes	it really is , i get to do what i love
No	What is your ultimate life goal?
Yes	"My husband's family owns a farm. We want to eventually ""retire"" to take over for that. We're both in tech so I have a lot innovation ideas for the farm"
Yes	What a beautiful idea. More and more people are moving that way. My husband and I have similar plans.
Yes	I agree, I love farms because it feels so natural.
No	Oh, thats interesting. Whats your favorite genre of books?
Yes	I enjoy mostly science fiction books.
Yes	Really?! I love Sci-fi and Paranormal!
Yes	 and paranormal , those are usually good books to get into .
No	Who's your favorite?
Yes	stephen king probably
Yes	I love Robert McCammon.  
Yes	I loved his song Starfish & Coffee when I was little.
No	Cool. What Stephen King Movie adaptation do you like best? 
Yes	the original IT, dreamcatcher and the mist were really good
No	I grew up on a huge farm most of my childhood years and we focused on cotton and corn mostly.
Yes	I was in college before I learned that the corn you see when you drive through country areas is mostly for animal feed! I always thought it was normal corn
Yes	That's right, and the crows and some other animals really think it's for them lol. As busy as farm life was, I always loved reading and found time for it.
Yes	I fantasize about moving to the country sometimes. I've only ever lived in the city. It would be a great way to grow up.
Yes	I love living in the country! I always get worried and uneasy when traveling to a large city like Atlanta.
Yes	Halloween's better in the city, though. More trick-or-treating density. I had a huge sweet tooth as a kid and would map out my route like a general.
Yes	I still like bats, though :D
Yes	haha bats are pretty neat as long as they dont get too close to me
Yes	They're adorable! When I lived on Mackinac Island, we'd find them hanging from the stairsteps every morning. If it weren't for the whole rabies thing...

Yes	wow thats really cool and nice of you! no where near as extreme but i foster cats here and there for my local humane society

No	When things like this happen I find it helpful to remember how insignificant we are in the big scheme of things.
Yes	But I need to feel that my home is safe and I can feel secure.
Yes	You should think about getting a security system. I got one after my moms house was broken into.
Yes	Its  like the meat that I eat I have to know that it is safe.
Yes	Well that was a strange direction but ok. I really like having a security system. I recommend it
Yes	I also like to feel safe when I go to hear my favorite band safety is very important to me so I will consider a system
Yes	I'm not sure what your favorite band has to do with your security system.
No	Do you have a contract on you security system?
Yes	Yes. My previous service was for 5 years but I think my new one is just for 3
No	Yeah, straight from the tap is the best way to get it!\

Yes	True that brother. Say you got any animals?
Yes	I have 2 pets. What about you?
Yes	I got a horse, he's a real cowboy's horse, but he ain't too friendly none. I always try talking to him and he just ignores me.

No	LOL!  that is so cool. daughters are cool.  my daughter still giggle and crack jokes with each other. she is 25.
No	My daughter is 19 and, now that she's grown, we look (and find) deep hidden meanings in Looney Tunes. And Spongebob.
Yes	LOL! and sesame street ... even thought they are puppets ... are my favorite to think deeply about. they really are people in your neighborhood!
Yes	Yes! Jim Henson had REAL people in mind when he designed those guys!!!

No	Depends on if you have them trained. I have my cats trained to sit and stay like a dog would.
Yes	interesting. I like to take my dog fishing with me. I cant see taking a cat on a boat lol
No	I mean if you count them fishing in the fish tank. Haha
No	haha I don't know, Cats are cute, but I have such a strong bond with my dog, I can't see getting that with a cat
No	Depends on the cat. They choose you you know. :)
Yes	well I've met a lot of cats and none have chose me yet lol  Dogs love me though

Yes	I've got 3 sisters.  Adore them!
Yes	Sounds exciting.  I've heard girls fight over the bathroom time, with make up, hair, and all.  Was that an issue at your house?
Yes	It was a huge issue!  My oldest sister was the bathroom hog - she was always sitting on top of the sink and listening to the Beatles!
Yes	Did any of your sisters, or you, take dance lessons?  I'm studying to be a ballet dancer.

Yes	I've been to Chicago for a couple of days, but that's about it for Illinois. Been to TN?
Yes	Yeah actually! I've been to summer camps around the Chattanooga area so I have several friends from there. Have you ever heard of Baylor Summer Camps?
Yes	No, I haven't, but I love Chattanooga. Pretty down on the riverfront. Nashville is a great city, also. Have you gone to a Bears game?
Yes	Personally, I work out my body more than my mind, it will allow me to be healthier and live longer. 
Yes	that is good advice . i will try to keep it in mind . do you like sports ?
Yes	I do like sports. I like soccer the most. It has the best fans.
Yes	I love watching soccer .
Yes	Have you ever been to a soccer game? I go to as many as I can, but I have to travel two hours to see them.
Yes	No i have never been but i hope i am able to one day. Was it better than watching it on TV ?
Yes	It is much better. Have you been to the circus?

Yes	You should! I love the circus, I actually work in a circus.
Yes	that sounds interesting . how do you like working in the circus ?
Yes	That is cool. I like to drink coffee when I wake up. Do you exercise?
No	I love coffee, actually. I drink a few cups every morning!
Yes	Me too. I like to use a french press when I have time. I like to measure the water and beans using a scale.
Yes	That would be helpful. I use a normal coffee maker.
No	Do you also add milk and sugar to your coffee?
Yes	Yes, black coffee is too bitter for me. Do you add sugar or milk?
No	That sounds like it would be beautiful!
No	I can't wait, everyone says it is the most magical place on Earth!
No	I believe it. Anything near a beach tends to hold magical properties. Paradise
Yes	I'm super excited. I'd love to live in a beach house. Have you ever been to Clearwater Beach before?
Yes	I have actually. Out in Florida? 
Yes	Yep. Clearwater is in Pinellas County near Tampa here on the Gulf coast of Florida. Nowadays I live in Palm Harbor.
Yes	Beautiful area. My brother and I want to move there. He thinks he is a viking. What a weirdo
Yes	Being by the ocean, seeing boats could give him a small fantasy to keep the memories alive and well. Viking means pirate in the Old english. Fun Fact :)
Yes	Thats interesting. My masters degree I am currently getting is in italin literature. Do you know anything about that?
Yes	Very cool. I thought about majoring in Italian, too, but didn't. I hope your degree helps you land a job you'd like! I don't know much about it
No	when in reality introverts are the best business owners

No	OK, I plan on seeing everything. Have you been to Universal before?
No	No my family went one year but i was at a bowl game for my college. I am more of a Disneyworld gal anyway. 
Yes	Awesome! haven't been to Disneyworld yet. Which park there was your favorite?
Yes	I would say magic kingdom. Its such a generic answer but I feel like I couldnt narrow it down to just one.
No	It's a nice car, plenty of room for kids and dogs. Wish I could afford an upgrade.
No	I'm sure it is an amazing car!  They seem so nice!  Maybe one day soon you can get one too!
Yes	I've been putting in a lot of overtime, but I'm starting to feel stressed out.
No	Sorry to hear.  I think you need a little time off.  Stress is a killer.
No	Yeah, the money is nice but it's not worth sacrificing my mental health.
No	I totally understand.  You must take good care of yourself and your mental health.  Maybe take a nice long relaxing bath tonight?
No	That sounds nice, maybe I'll call in sick tomorrow too.
No	"Lol, yes!  A ""mental health day"" is in order!  "
No	My perfect mental health day would probably be staying in bed, hanging out with the dogs, having food delivered, and reading a good book.
No	That sounds like a really great day!  I think I'll do exactly the same thing tomorrow.  But I will also play some music.  
Yes	It's actually not that bad.  I plan on making it tonight, I'm more productive at night anyway.
No	It sounds like a oarty food. ARe you having a party?
No	Yes, it's a Halloween party.
No	Are you putting a holiday twist on it?

No	Yea, that is definitely an outside spider!
Yes	my cat was playing with it
No	Haha cats are so fun to watch catch bugs, just got to be careful to not let them eat too many
No	they were chasing the leaves this morning when the wind was blowing 
No	Cats never let you have a dull moment

Yes	Since i can remember . I really enjoy it and I've learned a lot. 
Yes	thats very nice. do you like caramel cappuccino's? they are my favorite drink. Maybe we could get some sometime.
No	Those are really good.  Have you had the Creme Brule' ones with the crunchy caramel pieces on top from Starbucks?
No	I haven't. Are they any good? it sounds good.
Yes	It's probably my favorite one.  I like the crunch of the sugar.  I'm a texture person.  They should start having them around the holidays again.
Yes	Oh i like that. I'll have to try one when they are available. I doubt it will dethrone my favorite drink but I do like to try new things.
No	I totally get it.  I would never want to dethrone someone's favorite.  Haha!  So what do you for a living?
Yes	I work retail. Wish i could be reading for money instead, but it pays the bills.
No	I understand.  I bet you have some good stories to tell from your job. 
Yes	I never knew that either. I've never researched it that much.
No	that must be why i did not know !
No	Do you think NASA astronauts have clapped some alien cheeks?
No	I believe the do.
No	I hope those suits of theirs offer lots of protection lol. 
No	I don't think so that where crabs come from
No	Lol, that makes a lot of sense. Not to mention the weird half alien looking people walking around. 
No	Yeah. They never walk straight when i see them.
No	Would you ever want to be an astronaut?
Yes	Honestly, I wouldn't mind it. LOL
Yes	yes I will 
Yes	That is good, if I was in that position I would demand the room color be purple.

Yes	They are very good and loyal dogs. Yes a quiet place to live is key.
Yes	when did you get them all? I agree, me and my wife are very happy.
Yes	3 years ago. I bought them all in the same day. They were puppies and now best friends.
No	that's what I call a puppy brigade!
No	Because I forgot my wedding anniversary
No	Oh no! That's always an awkward situation. How did you recover?
No	I took my wife to a very expensive restaurant and got a nanny to take care of our boy.
No	That sounds like a lovely evening. Which restaurant did you go to?
Yes	We went to Rome. It was pretty cool. We stayed in a convent just a block from the Spanish Steps.
Yes	Last time I went on vacation I got a little too crazy and ended up coming back with two tattoos!
No	Hey, permanent souvenirs! Nice! What did you get?
Yes	I got red flames across both arms. The color contrasts well with my curly red hair.
Yes	You're lucky. I love red hair. I'm blonde and used to dye my hair red, but it never looked natural. My skin coloring or something was off.
Yes	Actually I think contrast wasn't the right word. It's better to say that it complements my red hair!
No	I think contrasting and complementary colors might be the same? Like purple/yellow and red/green are complementary colors, but they are pretty contrast-y.
Yes	That might be true. Unfortunately I don't think I know much about the subject.
Yes	Oh, I don't either. Doesn't stop me from speculating, though! What's your jam? What do you know a lot about?
Yes	Music. I could tell you everything there is to know about any genre.
Yes	I understand that, what's why I got tattoos, they bring me back to center

No	Exactly, I'm glad someone else understands!
Yes	It is a good way to put your emotions into your artwork 
No	I agree! I feel like recycling is also a great trait!
Yes	I agree too! And you can to some great art while recycling. Art has really helped me as I am struggling with my marriage.
No	Yes, art is the best. There's nothing quite like it!
No	That is true. It allows you to express yourself whether you are sad or happy.  
No	Exactly! Tattoos are the ultimate expression of self
No	Agreed.   I have one symbolic with a specific meaning pertinent to me.
No	Anthropology. I know nothing about it. 
No	I see. Anthropology is broadly, the study of man. The term was coined in the Renaissance.
Yes	Yes. She may go into phycology. She enjoys human behavior studies.  
Yes	That is exciting!  I have a masters as well.  I love learning!

No	Do you like that thumpy techno stuff, then?
Yes	Actually I prefer soothing music or old time rock and roll.
No	What's your favorite song ever?

No	I think I would like some alone time, as long as I could stay busy filming
Yes	The positive of living alone is that I was able to decorate however. I painted the walls purple, my favorite color.

Yes	I've been to Rome! You can walk all day there and see so many architectural delights. I didn't; go away this year.

Yes	lol. I'm very particular about movie theater behavior--having your phone out is another irritation of mine.
Yes	Or crunching and rustling sweets. I get very irritable when that happens. 
No	It's a lot of irritation to put up with considering how expensive it is to go to the movies now!
No	One near us has dropped its prices. They still charge a lot for popcorn and dodgy hotdogs thought. 
No	Ha!  We actually still have a working drive in movie theater out here that is nice to visit in the summer

Yes	Smoothies are delicious and healthy. I am decent about my diet. Do you go to the gym?
Yes	I like to work out at home and go running in the park
No	A jog in the park is great to get some fresh air as well. Definitely better than the gym
No	And cheaper! Get some sun, pat some dogs, see nature. What more could you want?
No	haha definitely . only invention i need is more time in the day to paint
Yes	I love a good glass of wine every once in a while, so long as I am not with my kids or at my shop

No	OH! That's a big one. I think I read somewhere that it goes nearly 90mph!
Yes	yes and it has  (at one point) the longest drop of 75m. I also like any water ride. 
Yes	Water rides are pretty cool most of them don't have as steep of drops so they tend to be easier on me.
Yes	I get a headache on most roller coasters because of the banging around. 
No	yeah they can definitely be strenuous. I would much rather be at home playing video games
Yes	I love the sights and sounds of an amusement park, and the food. 
Yes	Me too. I'm not really a big fan of rides but the food is the best part!
Yes	No it just hurts and can't get in the dentist for some time.
No	I'm sorry to hear that.  Tooth pain is something awful to have to deal with.
No	Yes it is but I will be fine, just one of those things. Speaking of tooth pain, do you have halloween plans?
No	I plan to hide in my basement with my two boxers and watch scary movies.
No	Oh fun! My mom has a boxer. I am taking my little girl trick or treating.

Yes	I have a lot of games too. Which kind is your favorite? I like RPGâ€™s
No	You have alot of games!? How many!? I have a fair amount but not what id call alot! I love MMO's! Sorry if im taking what you said too literally
Yes	I love MMOâ€™s too, maybe a total of 40 games if not under
No	Ah, okay haha, I was thinking hundreds. Sorry, I take things too literally sometimes.
No	Lol maybe if I count digitally as well. And other systems. In general I normally only count my switch and ps4. The only things I play
No	Ah, I see! that makes sense. Which do you like more, the switch or the ps4?
Yes	Thatâ€™s a tough one. I like my switch for overnight travel. But the ps4 beats when it comes to serious gaming. How about you?
Yes	That makes sense, I personally love the switch because of all of the nintendo exclusives.
Yes	True,  but the core gaming is important to me. Iâ€™m a CoD fan
Yes	I really like food from my home area.
Yes	Fresh seafood is the best. I'm kind of like a flamingo I'm always eating shrimp.
No	There's nothing like Seafood off the coast of Florida.
No	I agree with you there. Florida is a great state, a lot to do there outdoors which i love.
No	I would say the only not so fun area would be The Glades. I love the outdoors also.
No	The glades is beautiful to look at but I wouldn't like to hang around there because of the gators.
No	I certainly would not want to try to introduce myself to the gators.
No	They are scary animals that shouldn't be messed with.
No	You'd be amazed at the fact that people still do.
No	I know all about it. Florida man is a real thing. Stupid people will do stupid things.
Yes	I am from the south, Alabama, how about you?
Yes	I read a lot. Alabama seems to come up in several of Stephen King's books.
Yes	I also read alot, love learning new things. What else do you like reading?
Yes	I read the Bible more often than anything else. My son is an author so of course I read his books.
No	Oh really? Does he write fiction or nonfiction?
Yes	mostly fiction. I help edit his books.
Yes	You guys must have a good relationship. I have made some money on side by editting various mediums.
Yes	He does not pay me for editing, but I get sneak peaks and several FREE books. We do have a great relationship.
No	Free books is a great perk. Is he your only child?
Yes	No, I have 3. Sadly for me the oldest is in eternity.
Yes	yes, my situation has improved, i have learned to enjoy being alone now and spend a lot of my time hiking.
No	Hiking is a wonderful hobby. Have you ever considered doing it in a group?
Yes	I have hiked in groups before but I think i prefer doing it by myself. It eliminates distractions and allows me to be fully submerged in nature. Do you hike?
No	not often, maybe i should more
No	I would recommend it. What do you do as a hobby?
Yes	i play badminton. im in a rec league but we take it pretty seriously
No	oh wow. that is neat. do you play singles or doubles?
Yes	i usually do singles, but sometimes we double up if there are a lot of people there
No	that is cool. how long have you been playing for?
Yes	a long time. i messed around with it as a kid but i got more serious in college
Yes	I work at a hospital. I am a doctor!
Yes	wow! do you enjoy your work? i am a grocery store manager.
No	I love it, but going home is always nice. How is the grocery store life treating you?
No	busy ... busy ... busy.  weekends are always mad, but, it is always good to get good discount on healthy food.
No	What's your favorite food?
No	lasagna ... not so healthy. but it is my favorite.  what about you?
No	I like grapes. Their purple color is very appealing to me.
No	those are my favorite produce. i have some sitting in the fridge right now! i like to eat them with almonds.
No	I wear a lot of purple so I don't stain my clothes when I spill the grapes.
No	wow! purple grapes and purple scrubs.  i bet you get lots of smiles :)
Yes	I've heard of it.. I actually was held hostage once during a store robbery.
Yes	Oh wow, I am glad you are okay. Nothing you can do to avoid it in public but I have a dog for home protection.
No	I don't have a dog right now.. but we had one growing up.. my dad wasn't home much as he was a cop at the time.
No	I am always home baking and cooking. I would worry about a family member having such a dangerous job.
No	Well he's retired now.. so fortunately it worked out ok for him :)  I love to cook, but I'm not a very good baker :)
No	Aww good, I bet he enjoys retirement. That move Hostage showed how important a cops job is.
No	Yeah it did.. it was actually fairly accurate, too.  Law Enforcement, in general, go through a LOT of turmoil in their lives.
No	I have to most respect for them because they have to deal with extreme mental stress. 
No	Absolutely.. not a lot of jobs out there where you are literally unsure if you're going to be returning home alive at the end of the day.
No	That would definitely be a job I would not want, but we need heroes to stop bad people like in Hostle. 
Yes	No I just let it dry, It was only water to it wasnt smelly or anything
Yes	Thank goodness!  I sat on chocolate once when I was in middle school and I was wearing white!
No	Oh no, that just cant dry out
No	No not at all.  I had to wear my sweatshirt around my waist all day so that saved me hahaha!
No	Thats good though. Im sure not very many people even noticed
No	Not too many.  Only a few friends but we had a good laugh!
No	Haha childhood memories are always fun to look back o0n
No	Yes, especially the ones where you wanted to crawl in hole.  Where did you grow up?
No	I grew up in Alabama
No	Not too far from me.  I am from Georgia. 
Yes	He is just crazy! I think someone dared him.
Yes	Interesting.. Did he get in trouble? Was this at a high school or something? And does he take gymnastics?! Back flips are hard!
No	It was at work at a family business. He probably will not be in trouble.
No	Oh, I thought it was at school.  How old was he?
No	I'm sorry, yes at school. Thanks for correcting me. He is 17. He should know better.
No	Yah, it's a wonder he wasn't hurt, or someone else hurt.  He should be a cheerleader!
No	I agree. There should be more male cheerleaders.
No	Where I went to school, we had a separate squad, of just male cheerleaders.  They used to do backflips every time the team scored.
No	That sounds great. A combined squad would be fantastic also.
No	Especially in the locker room!  LOL!
Yes	Still figuring it out a little since I'm just eighteen and fresh out of high school with honors! Anything outdoors I love though. You?
Yes	I enjoy outdoors a lot!
No	What are some of your favorite outdoor activities? I love visiting national parks, any water sports, camping, and hiking.

No	I respect people that like keeping up with trends and fads because I never did really.
No	I change the color of my hair often too. These days I have it brown!
No	We have that in common then. I like coloring mine blonde! It's dark naturally.
No	Cool! I love blonde too! But I don't think it matches with my skin color!
Yes	Thanks! I'm getting over it. I wish I've been to more places! Specially to a city
Yes	You have to stay strong I get teased all the time about my occupation as a short order cook at a local diner.
No	Yeah! Everyone has their own story! What's there to tease about what you're doing!
Yes	I guess I am not making as much as my other friends or associates
No	I'm the same!
Yes	It's ok I learn to destress from it all. Like this past summer i hiked the appalachian trail it was amazing.
No	Oh cool! How long was it? Did you go by yourself?
Yes	It took me a while to do so but I went about 3 years ago and I would love to go back. 
Yes	That sounds like a great idea for me. Specially here in Ohio, you can find many natural trails
No	That is amazing. What do you do for fun?
No	It is! After trying for so long, I finally feel happy.
Yes	I got divorced two years ago but I am very happy!
No	Why did you get divorced? What about the relationship made you unhappy?
Yes	It just didn't work out, nothing bad though! I got my cat out of the deal and that's what matters most!
No	Cats are the best! I have my eye on a little black kitten myself!
Yes	I am such a cat person! I have a snowshoe cat and she is the best

Yes	Of course. I played soccer growing up myself.
No	That is awesome! What position did you play?
Yes	I'm a forward like Abby Wambach.
Yes	Very nice! I played some forward and goalie!
No	That is great.  How many years did you play?
Yes	I played for eight years, it was so much fun!
Yes	It is very fun.  I played for six years!
Yes	It depends on the cases! I work with not very fun cases
No	you have to be really logical to be able to apply the legal theories
No	yes, very cold and not emotionally involved
Yes	I love watching the legal shows - and try to figure out who is guilty
No	which one is your favourite?

No	He's recovering. But I have to admit I'm really nervous about the after effects and recovery.
No	Yes I could understand that.  I'm sure that he will recover.  It will take some time.
Yes	I hope so. I'm pretty anxious about it but I'm sure he'll be okay eventually.
No	You need some prayers right now.  Just know that he is being well taken care of.
No	Thank you so much! You're very kind.
Yes	Oh thanks.  I appreciate that!  I have lost both parents so I know how nervous you must be.
No	Oh, I am so sorry for your loss.
Yes	Thank you!  It's been over 10 years.  But that type of feeling stays with you.
Yes	I am very lucky not to have lost anyone that close to me but I imagine it does. 
No	Of course they say time heals all wounds.  We just have to have faith and move on.
No	Yes you're right, I believe that time is the best way to heal.
Yes	I am, I love the band Van Halen
Yes	Oh I like them too. I like that song I think it is called Eruption.

Yes	i live in Florida, we just havent had the chance to go together . I just moved.
Yes	Florida got the best beaches. You definitely need to try that! I love Florida!

No	How do you get the money if you do not have a job?
Yes	I was fortunate enough to inherit a trust fund, and you?
Yes	That is awesome! I am a manager for a trucking company I work a lot.
No	Interesting! Do you have a family?  Long hours can be hard away from family.
Yes	Yeah but sometimes I struggle paying bills so to keep the lights on I have to work those long hours.
Yes	"I was always told that the reward for a ""good deed"" can actually be found in the deed itself.  You sound like a very responsible individual.  "
No	That is very nice of you to say, so since you don't work do you take a lot of cool vacations?
Yes	I believe that we need to inject light anywhere we find darkness. We can't save everyone but by changing one life we can effect the future.
Yes	For sure. I bet it gets hot in the summers working on farms though. I am not that fond of hot and humid temperatures.
Yes	Yeah, it definitely does. You get used to it though, I've been running my family farm since I graduated high school.
Yes	I bet that is an honor in itself! Do you listen to music while working? I like all music except country really.
Yes	Haha, yup I sure do. Country music seems to go hand in hand with the farming profession, so lots of that.
Yes	lol, I can imagine. I like some of the classic rock music that blends in some country like the Eagles and Lynyrd Skynyrd.
Yes	"Big Skynyrd fan myself. I had a girlfreind who eloped with my best friend, ""Freebird"" was on repeat for awhile after that haha."
Yes	That's awesome. Sweet Home Alabama is pretty much a theme song for the area I live in!

Yes	I usually dress casually, even at the restaurant I waitress at.
No	Really, do you serve customers by supplying them with food and drink as requested?
Yes	That I do. They don't serve alcoholic drinks where I work, but I serve all the others! Sometimes large families also.
No	I see, you have a very important role in a restaurant. I hope you are paid well for it!
Yes	Well you know, most of my income I get from tips. I do pretty well with those, fortunately. How is your work?
Yes	it sort of pays well , but as long as i can pay the bills i'm happy .
Yes	I hear that. Having a side job or two can always help also. Especially if you can work from anywhere and do as little or as much as you want.
No	Yeah, definitely. I'm always looking for ways to make more money.
Yes	Most of us have to these days, especially with the way the economy's been for years.
Yes	Yea. I'm always worried that a recession could hit and last a year or more! Which means an overcrowded job search field.
No	Donna Karen is my favorite brand, I dont care what the other kids think. what brand do you like to wear?

No	Not cold; just WET. We have had torrential rains. Cold is coming behind the rains.
No	I am not ready for the cold. I like summer. What is your favorite season?
No	Summertime for sure. The days are longer. I can always find a way to get cool. In winter it's hard to stay warm.
No	I agree. I dont like when its dark in the morning already and dark so early at night too. 
No	Yes that is very depressing. Totally makes me want to stay at home.
No	That's cool. Do you have any tattoos?

No	BC?  Is that British Columbia?
No	Yes, have you been around the West Coast at all? 
No	Not yet, but I've been to Canada.  How cold was the water when you were surfing there?

No	yes i love it. it is good for my blood type. i learned about it while studying the blood type diet. 
No	Is there  a diet which is just Vegetraian+chicken?

Yes	It's been 5 years now, but feels like yesterday. 
No	I'm very sorry to hear that. 
Yes	Thank you. It definitely gets better as time goes on. Luckily I love my job and the horses I work with take my mind off of things.

Yes	Did she say how long it was going on for?
No	Yes she said it has only been going on for 3 months she met him at the beach during our family surfing trip smh. How would you react? 
No	During a family trip?! I would be upset, especially hearing it was during that trip!  Do you think she will tell your dad?
Yes	My exact thinking like how could you during family memories. She has no choice if she don't I will. 
Yes	How long did you give her to tell him?
No	I didn't give her one. How long should I give her before spilling the truth? 
No	I would give her a week, or do you think that is too much time?

No	That sounds very pretty, I bet the northeast has some vibrant colors right now too.

Yes	Wow! I want to come visit your garden! Ha! Do you grow the plants directly in your yard or do grow the plants in large containers?
Yes	A mix of both. I usually do half and half. Although certain veggies grow better in pots
Yes	Well, i live in the midwest and it gets really cold out here. Do you recommend any plants that can grow in harsh weather?

Yes	That goes over my head. I don't know enough to speak on it.
Yes	What's it like to not almost die from eating apples?
Yes	I don't really like them much anyway. My mom does though, so I keep them in the house.
No	I, too, like your mom 
Yes	She's actually a really nice person, but I do wish I could live alone at times.
No	I can only imagine. How old is your Mom? 
Yes	She's young- only 55, but she has MS and needs someone to take care of her.
Yes	That's horrible, my Mom is pushing 70 and went to Florida because that's where old people go.
No	Is she still in good health?
No	No, Not lately. Where are you from?
Yes	Estonia. It's a beautiful place!
No	Wow i have heard about the place but not been there ..
No	It's pretty small, but the beautiful scenery is great for relaxing and gathering inspiration.
No	describe the landscape .
No	It's pretty flat for the most part, though there is a large amount of coastline on the border of the country.
No	Wow Great! What is your favorite song?
Yes	My favorite would have to be All of Me by John Legend.
Yes	wow good, Mine is FRIENDS by Anna marie
No	Didn't Marshmello also feature in that song?
Yes	I think of all the wonderful trips we used to take together.
No	That's nice to have those memories. Do they help a bit?
Yes	Oh, yah.  We had some great times.  Lots of laughs.  Like the time I got sicker than a dog while we were in New Mexico.
No	Oh boy - that sounds like quite the memory! Why did you get sick?
No	Well, we stopped for lunch at this roadside place, it was really busy, figured it was safe.  It's why I can't stand the sight of tacos to this day.
No	Ah, say no more - I catch your drift. I'm sure glad that didn't happen to me - I love tacos!
No	So, do you see your parents often?
Yes	Yes, I am lucky to see them every couple weeks or so
No	I'm sure they enjoy that. Do you discuss your work?
Yes	I do once in a while, but not very in-depth. Not sure they understand fully what I do. But that's okay!
No	I don't suppose they're hiring where you work?
No	Not that I know of, but if I hear of anything I will let you know for sure!
Yes	It really is. I never had a close friend like David until I joined the ballet company that we dance in together.
No	My best friend dies several years ago from cancer. I really miss talking to her.
No	I'm so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine how difficult that must be. 
Yes	Death is a sad part of life, Now my best friend is my lizard named Nagini.   lol
No	Is Nagini named after Voldemort's lizard from Harry Potter?
No	Yes it is. Do you have any pets?
Yes	I have a German Shepherd named Elsa. I love her.
No	Is Elsa named from the movie FROZEN?
No	Agreed. When I'm having a bad day, I think about how bad the people in third world countries have it.
No	we need to more for them, you dont see enough of it on social media
No	So true. It amazes me how much people fail to realize their fortunes. I watch people in bars act like they have not a single care in the world.
No	agreed
Yes	Being an angry person already, it just makes matters worse, ya know?
No	you are so right there i suppose
No	It makes me want to be more approachable so I can inform people on the horrors other countries have to endure.
No	yeah i would love to see how the rest of the world lives
No	Hopefully one day we all can. Like the people in Venezuela who are without food, water and many without electricity!
No	i know that's so horrible . so many have perished already
Yes	Yes, I have 2 and I have to fight them for the halloween candy as its my passion lol
Yes	I love candy.
No	Oh gosh, whats not to like ey ? So, what do you do for a living ?
Yes	i work at an amazing candy shop .
Yes	No WAY !!!! My dream job, rather than what I actually do - a courier!
No	Really? That's interesting. What is your job?
Yes	It isn't as interesting as it sounds, a lot of driving and logging parcels in and finding houses and not being able to deliver. I prefer your job lol
No	Hahahaha.  That's pretty good.  The problem is this candy is very special.  
No	WHy so special ?
No	Children like candy to eat very much due to its taste.
No	It truly is bizarre.
No	Did you end up getting hurt in the fight and suing him?
Yes	I did end up getting hurt and dumping him.
Yes	You are better off without him.  You should definitely marry someone in the military.  We are honorable people. 
Yes	I found my husband after that garbage happened.
Yes	That's great news!  Where did you meet your husband?  I met mine while stationed in Hawaii.  We are both serving in the military. 
Yes	I met him in a business meeting. I run my own consulting firm.
No	What do you consult on?  That must be exciting to run your own firm!
Yes	I work in marketing. What branch of the military are you in?
Yes	My favorite color is blue, so I joined the Air Force.  Plus, men in jumpsuits are just hot! Ha Ha
Yes	Yes, They really are! I play football too
Yes	That's cool! I am terrible at sports but I admire people who are good that them.
Yes	I've been playing it since high school. Now I play in college
Yes	Wow, you must be really good then.  My husband played high school football too but stopped after a couple of really bad concussions.
No	oh that's too bad! Do you do a job?
Yes	I'm a teacher.  How about you?
Yes	I'm doing an internship and attending second year in college
Yes	What field is your internship in?
Yes	Engineering! I like it so far
Yes	That's a challenging field of work--what type of engineering are you interested in?
Yes	So true, are you married also?
Yes	Yes, I am married to a great guy. We have been married 20 years. You?
Yes	Right behind you, 19 years.
No	Great, happy for you! I hope you guys have continued happiness.
No	Thanks, same to you.  You don't hear of these long lasting marriages much anymore.
Yes	So true! Changing the subject, do you have a favorite color?
Yes	I go through phases of what colors I like but I would have to pick yellow as my all time favorite. How about you?
Yes	Oh I do like yellow too but red is my all time favorite.
No	Yellow just seems to brighten up things for me, and puts off happy vibes.
No	Yes, I agree it does brighten up things. 
No	What other foods do you like?  
Yes	Oh, I like all foods, just vegetables most of all.  I do love Cheetos, though.  
Yes	Cheetos are good!  I'm not a big fan of vegetables.  If I had to choose, I would say green beans are my favorite.  
Yes	I like green beans, too.  Especially when they're just picked.  How do you like to cook them?
Yes	I like them best baked or using the air fryer.  Have you every used an air fryer? 
No	No, but I'm interested in them.  Are they really healthier than deep frying?
No	I think the food tastes just as good if not better.  They have to be healthier, since no oil is used.  
No	That makes sense =)  I want to eat healthy, but do indulge in fried food sometimes - this could help that.
No	Yes it could.  I love using mine.  I have cooked many meals in it.  Pork chops are my favorite in the air fryer.  
No	Oh wow, that sounds SO good.  I wonder if I could make fries out of carrots in it...?  Dip 'em in ranch ;)
No	A bit yeah. Do you like movies?
No	I do I love movies. I mostly like documentaries though. What is your favorite genre of movies?
No	rom-coms. Although I like documentaries too
No	My favorite rom-com is must love dogs. What is your favorite rom-com?
No	Love actually 
No	That is another one that I really like. I love how all the stories come together in some way. 
Yes	Yeah, they are all good. What food do you like?
Yes	I love Italian food. What about you?
Yes	I really like cake, not a fan of veg though
Yes	I love cheesecake what is your favorite cake?
No	I didn't do any specific program, I just paid a little extra on my membership to get a personal trainer!
Yes	Nice, what made you decide to get a trainer as opposed to finding a program yourself?
Yes	Having a trainer made me stay consistent and kept pushing me even when I wanted to quit.
Yes	That makes sense. Do you have any pets?
Yes	I have a dog. I want to get another so he's not so lonely. Do you have pets?
Yes	Yes, I'm a big fan of lizards so I own a few of those. What kind of dog do you own?
Yes	I have a German Shepherd, he's still a puppy. I got him for my girlfriend a few months ago, but she tells me she doesn't want him anymore.
Yes	That's too bad, I've always loved german shepherds, they're very smart.
Yes	He's already so smart! She tells me she's leaving me. I'd choose my dog and guitar over her any day!
Yes	Haha, I hear that. I'm big into my guitar as well, I've always been the guy with long hair and a rebellious rock attitude.
No	i do not seems happy with it
Yes	is there any think your looking for in a new job?
Yes	yes
No	and what would that be?

Yes	ok i will do that
No	OKay, have a good day!

Yes	I go running every weekday morning and go to the gym on Saturdays. 
No	Thats cool, must be in shape
No	Thank you, I have lost 15 pounds in the past 2 months.
No	Has it changed much over the years?
No	To be honest, i have never visited it yet. But I am very eager to go there
No	I'm in tech, so I work with a lot of people from China. It's an interesting culture, from what I can tell.
Yes	That is nice! I wish I can go to those countries. My dad is from there
Yes	Cool. Do you speak the language yourself? Do you have contact with family that still ive there?
Yes	no . do you speak other languages ?
Yes	Me? Yeah. Spanish, Italian, French, Ladino. Had Greek and latin in school, but don't remember much.
No	That's interesting. A lot of cool things to learn for sure.
Yes	I love to travel. I'd love to travel to another planet and meet alients!
Yes	i would love to travel some day . i've never really been anywhere
No	That is so sad, but I am sure you can keep in touch and look forward to trips as excuses to get away
No	How long have you known them?
Yes	I have known them for about 30 years. She understands my quirks and know how bad my allergies are.
No	Having a best friend like that is so awesome
Yes	I am a vegetarian and so is she, how awesome is that.
No	How long have you been vegetarian?
Yes	I have been a vegetarian for 25 years
No	I've consideed it several times but I'm not sure I would be able to adjust
No	It has helped with my allergies tremendously.
No	I wonder if it could help my seasonal allergies?
No	If that's the case, prepare for battle!
No	Lets take the topic away from politics for now. What are your thoughts on video games? Particularly RPGs?
No	They're a good way to escape from reality! Do you have a favorite?
Yes	Its so hard to pick a favorite. A good one I recently got into is called The Outer Worlds. It's similar to older Fallout games.
Yes	I don't play them much myself, but I like to watch YouTubers play the games.
Yes	Ah, I do that whenever I cant afford to buy a game. I just love the immersive storytelling the games can provide
Yes	I like watching the gameplays so I can watch it like a movie. My favorite is The Last of Us.
No	The Last of Us is TOTALLY like a movie! The emotion that the characters convey is so well done.
No	Right! I love what Ellen Page did with the character.
No	The actors did a fantastic job. I really want to play the sequel eventually.
Yes	Very interesting, I love the taste, never attempted to make them
No	Do you think you will ever attempt to make them?
No	Not sure, its so easy to buy them lol  are they hard to make?
No	No, but they are a lot easier to buy. Anything else you like to eat?
Yes	I love food! I like to cook too, just never been much of a baker, so not sure about making bagels
Yes	Another foodie! I am more of a cook than baker as well. 
No	interesting. what type of food is your favorite to prepare? ittalian, hispanic..ect?
Yes	Most favorite would be bbq ribs, also love using the smoker to cook. Hispanic food is also a close favorite to make. 
Yes	I love to BBQ, I am most at home behind a grill. Nothing tastes better than food cooked or smoked over natural wood
No	Yes! Natural wood flavor is hard to beat. What do you grill mostly?
Yes	Same with my companion dog, lol - he doesn't even bark - but the big guy does!
Yes	I would love to get another dog soon, but I think a bigger one this time!
Yes	I'm always open to getting another dog - sometimes a see a pup and it's just love at first sight!
No	What kind of dog do you have now?
Yes	A little Pomeranian and a big German Shepherd!
Yes	Nice I love German Shephards! They are cute when puppies and monsters when they grow up, my kind of dog
Yes	lol, me too - my brothers actually picked him out, but he's become fonder of me over time (it's the treats, lol)
Yes	My mother is a makeup artist and has a dog herself. I think she would put make up on the dog if that were less weird lol
Yes	Bahahaha, I've seen pictures of dogs with makeup on online - tell me these aren't your mom!?
No	Not that I know of unless she has posted them secretly! Im waiting for her to come out with a business one day haha
Yes	I am currently a student, I am going to be a vet.
Yes	Oh wow!  That sounds like a rewarding career.  I love animals.
Yes	Me too! LOL! I have a pet dog, and she inspires me everyday. I can't wait to work with all types of animals. Do you have a pet?
Yes	Yes, I have a dog.  He's a rescue and the best dog ever, in my opinion. LOL  
Yes	I totally agree with having a rescue dog, or pet, they deserve loving homes. I personally not attracted to pure bred dogs, to many potentials for birth defects.
Yes	Yes, I agree.  I hear that a lot.  It seems like they know they were rescued and are now very much loved.
No	I really think rescued animals, actually rescue us more. 
No	Yes, I absolutely agree.  
No	How many hours do you work a week at the clinic?
Yes	I am at the clinic 40-50 hours.  It's not too bad though, most people are nice.  I get to do all the talking.  LOL
No	no, by the time i bought it there was not that sale
No	that is too bad.
No	i know!!
Yes	I need my laptop for my job as a professional translator, so I understand.
No	well is the moment to buy one, the prices are good now
No	That is good to know, I will have to look. 
No	do not miss the opportunity
No	What laptop brand did you get?
No	i got a mac 
No	Oh fancy! those do not usually go on sale often, its surprising to hear it did.
No	How many kids do you have?
Yes	2- but that is a lot, trust me.
No	I wouldn't know, I don't have any kids.  Do you have time for yourself with 2 kids?
Yes	Not really. I used to follow my favorite band's tour, but not anymore. :(
Yes	That's too bad.  I would love to be a band's fashion coordinator.  It would be right up my alley.
No	That sounds like fun! I always assumed bands just put on whatever clothes they felt like.
No	That's what they want you to think, but the biggest bands have their outfit coordination down to a science.
No	Hmm ,never really thought about it that way. Why do you think that is?
No	I think it's just all about image and what they try to portray.  Are you influenced by the way band's look, or just their music?
Yes	Their look doesn't matter much to me- I'm all about the music!
No	It was a huge mess. But I love her and forgive her when she misbehaves.
No	Animals are wonderful.  Most of the time.
No	Hah yes, most of the time. Do you have any pets?
No	2 dogs, and 2 cats.
No	That is quite a family. What are their names?
No	Alpha, Beta, Cato, and Dude.
No	ABCD. What will another pet be named beginning with E?
No	thinking about a bird named echo.  but there's little time to train a bird, with all my school studies.
No	Echo is a good name. My cat is named Starscream
No	Nice.  What do you do for a living?
No	I paint houses. What do you do?
No	Real estate.
No	I'm not entirely sure.
No	I'm not the least bit surprised, since she was considered a bit of an eccentric by her neighbors.
No	Anyone who is a hermit or recluse would be considered eccentric. A lot of creative people are as well
No	That's true. Anyone who marches to the beat of their own drum is often shunned.
No	When they should be welcomed and celebrated. Just because someone else's version of happy doesn't match our own doesn't make theirs wrong
No	That's totally right! In hindsight I'm sure people would have gotten to know her
No	I'm not so sure. Some things have progressed while others have not in my opinion
No	That is fair, I should have specified. Some people would have retrospectively been able to appreciate her work, had they known. She still wouldn't have appealed to everyone.
No	Hindsight is always 20/20
No	Indeed. Oh well at least we can appreciate her work now!
No	Our main bucket list item is to see the Northern Lights and after that, perhaps the Maldives. And retire somewhere in the mountains so we see snow every year.
No	Wow, that sounds awesome. Typically people want to get away from the cold in retirement, and here you are chasing it down.
Yes	One of us is originally from the Philippines and the other from the Deep South in USA, so we are both tired of the hot and humid weather lol
No	Haha, makes sense. I play jazz piano in a band, I may need to add the Maldives as a potential tour stop and see what the hype is about!
No	It's a beautiful island nation for sure. Jazz would sound great there! I love taking walks and listening to jazz actually.
No	That's awesome, it definitely soothes the soul! Would you say that it's your favorite genre?
Yes	For relaxing it would be my favorite genre of music. Although what I listen to most in general is classic rock.
No	Very cool. You mentioned one of you are from the Philippines, are you still able to speak the native tongue? 
No	Definitely, especially from my region of the Philippines. What's challenging is understanding Alabamian accents here, hehe.
No	Oh, I bet. French and Arabic are my second and third languages, and I can understand those better than accents in the deep south haha.
No	Teaching at a pretty large school
No	How long have you been  a teacher
Yes	Not too long been teaching for 8 years but only 2 at my current school!
No	Wow, that's great. Teachers are a blessing
No	Thank You, what do you do for work?
No	I work at a vets office
No	Oh thats great! I can't imagine diagnosing something that can't tell you whats wrong.
No	Yes it's rough but im just the assistant. i have gotten 2 snakes from people who would drop animals off and never come back
No	Thats so sad! But I guess they are better in your care then their previous owners.
No	Yeah, a lot of people just dont understand the care animals need
No	It will be expensive to treat as I only work part time right now at an aldi store.
No	I am sure she will be okay
No	Hopefully, I'm trying to take my daughter mind of off it. We are watching our favorite movie together, Titanic.
No	What is the movie about?
No	A ship from the early 1900s at sunk in the Atlantic ocean. I'm surprised you've never heard of it.
No	i did not know that but i have seen the movie
No	It's considered one of the greatest movies of all time.
No	It is a very nice movie.
No	It has been my favorite since it released in 1997
No	Good to see your interest. I too fond of this movie.
No	I should, I feel pretty bad about it.
No	Oh,I feel so sorry for you do you think you will get in trouble over this? 
No	I really hope I don't. I've never been in trouble at this job before
No	What type of work do you do?
Yes	I sell exotic pets
No	Do you make a lot of money doing this ?
No	i get by on it pretty well. It's a good way to provide for my 4 kids
No	That is great children are expensive 
No	they really are. 
No	They are always needing something .
No	Six Flaggs Fiesta Texas is such a blast!  It's a can't miss!
Yes	I have been! It is fun! It better now than it used to be my Twin, Jessica, and I thought it was boring when we were younger
No	They have the very best rollercoasters!  We ride those over and over.  This weekend is going to be Fright Fest which makes it extra fun!
Yes	I live in the DFW area so my oldest wants to go this weekend. My youngest son is blind though so I will need to find a sitter 
No	That will be nice.  The Dallas park is fun too.  I'm sorry your youngest can't go.
No	It will be okay. My oldest gets upset that there are things like this that we can't always do but he gets it. He's a good brother
No	Aww two brothers, that's sweet.  Sounds like they're close.
No	They are! How is the weather supposed to be this weekend? It's cold and raining here currently. 
No	It's about the same here in Austin.  I haven't checked the weather for the weekend.  Hope it doesn't rain!  Went from hot to not real fast.
No	haha! You can always count on Texas to be bipolar when it comes to the weather!
No	The beach can be so hot in the summer. I would rather go to a colder place
No	I don't mind the heat if I'm just sitting on the beach
Yes	I have an allergy to the sun, so it will always be a no for me, unless its late in the evening
No	Oh that's too bad. Does sunscreen help at all?
No	A little,but I still burn pretty bad. I do love going to the zoo to see the zebras
No	Me too! Tigers are my favorite animal. 
Yes	I have my car interior as zebra stripe, how odd is that for a older woman?
Yes	My glasses are held together with tiger stripe duct tape. So, not odd at all!
No	I would pay to see that, I bet you get a lot of compliments?
Yes	I think people who know me would say that it's fitting of my personality
Yes	Because I'm in the garden. My Favorite thing to do
No	Thats sounds like a good plan.How big is your garden
Yes	Its a small garden on my patio. I like to sit out there and drink my coffee
No	Sounds like a great way to relax eeh
No	Yes it is. My quiet space
No	And a good way to reflect especially with all thats going in the world
No	Yup, but I do need to call my friend about her ring. She has a late class so Ill call her tonight
No	Im sure she'll be excited to hear from you
No	I don't know, I just like the irreverence and spookiness of it
No	halloween is a fun holiday
No	What's your favorite holiday?
Yes	mine is probably christmas and you ?
Yes	Hmm, Halloween followed by Walpurgisnacht

No	I've never heard of that, what is it?
No	It's a Northern Athabaskan dialect, named after the Daketh people.
No	I like being retired, but I miss working, too.
No	It has to be nice to have more free time though. I live on a boat and plan to take it everywhere once I retire.
No	I miss going somewhere and being productive. It's hard to do when you don't have to.
No	yeah , that is true . i've a real passion for computer programming .
No	What do you love about it?
No	I just love learning new things and there is always something new to learn in programming.
No	What do you do in your free time?
No	I like to read, go hiking and I got married last year and he likes to play golf so I am trying to get into that now. 
No	Sort of, a specific state may have that, doubt it, but every state has something different. I know New Hampshire doesn't, I grew up there.
No	What was on that plate? 
No	The leaves fall where they may. 
No	aww that's pretty, would make a nice tattoo quote. Do you have any tattoo's?

No	I sure hope so, most girls like beards right? 
No	My guy has one. I can only speak for myself. I do:)
Yes	Does you boyfriend use any products for taking care of his beard? I have ingrown hair issues. 
No	I'm not sure what he uses. I know he belongs to some kinda club online. He has a ton of stuff. More than me!
No	Wow, a guy having more products than a woman, I am shocked. My sister has taken over our bathroom with all her stuff.
No	Thankfully we have two bathrooms so it isn't an issue. He doesn't take long though. Suprisingly
No	RAWWRR! That is such an amazing fact! 
No	What do you know about the world wide web?

Yes	Ballet is so beautiful and graceful. I'm sure it takes a great amount of discipline to learn to dance, especially ballet.
Yes	i agree, i also do yoga to keep my body limber and mind focused on dance night
Yes	I have tried yoga once or twice. It was okay. I should probably try it again sometime. My favorite exercise is riding my bicycle.
No	You should definitely try. You'll get addicted!
Yes	I have a friend that says it really relaxes her. There are a lot of health benefits for sure.
Yes	it does help a great deal. you just need to find a pace and all that is good for you
Yes	I am not a huge movie buff. I watch a lot of stand up comedy though.
No	Oh me too! I'm actually going to a show on friday.
No	What show?
No	Dusty Slay
No	I will have to check them out
No	He's been on Jimmy Kimmel a lot. 
No	I'll look him up. Have you heard of Iliza Sherslinger?
Yes	Yeah! I saw her in Nashville.
No	So lucky! I would love to see her live! 
No	Maybe next tour
Yes	Pretty bummed out.  She was my mom's sister and best friend.
No	i'm sorry to hear that . when did she pass ?
Yes	4 days ago.  She was visiting from the states too when she passed.
Yes	Hopefully your mom hasn't passed away, and you just haven't visited her in a while.
Yes	No, my mom is still alive and well.  She is taking it pretty hard though.  
No	i bet . be patient though . i am sure this is hard enough for her .
Yes	Yeah, how about you?  Are your parents still alive?
Yes	they are . are your parents still living ?
Yes	My mom is, but my dad passed away 10 years ago.
Yes	I hear that memory isn't very accurate sometimes... maybe it wasn't as bad as I remember? Your dad is a nice guy.
Yes	No, but I also didn't learn Spanish!
Yes	I did the same thing. It's too hard to learn at an older age. Especially when it's a mandatory school thing instead of an actual thing you WANT to learn.
No	And most highschool language teachers are utter garbage. The pace isn't fast enough and there's not enough immersion.
Yes	True, although I don't know about it not being fast enough. I think in my case it was too fast. Going from 'hola' to complex sentences in like two days
No	"Yeah, there's a balance to be sure. They also have you learn dumb things, like ""where is the library"" instead of basic conversation, like ""I'm hungry"""
Yes	True. Not sure who exactly would be looking for a library in another language. Maybe if it's like a famous landmark in Spain or something, but otherwise it's useless
Yes	There are a lot of great tools for learning languages now. Apps and such
No	For sure. I don't know that I'll ever get around to actually ever using one. Might need some incentive, like a spouse who speaks it
Yes	What language would you like to learn?
Yes	Probably Spanish would be the most useful since it's the second most common here. Otherwise, French would be cool because it's more rare and romantic. Hah
No	That sounds exciting! Ever cover any cool stories?
Yes	I used to love writing about sports news and current events
No	Very cool. I'm a scientist. Experimenting has been such a part of my life since I was little.

Yes	Reading can be great. What's your favorite genre?

Yes	I haven't read much of that. Can you recommend anything I should put on my list?
No	Well, Game of Thrones is really popular right now, it's long but really good
No	I would like to find a place to relax and work on cars. I love cars. What about you?
Yes	I want to get a car one day i think.
No	Well when you do get a car I would be happy to help with any questions or problems. That's my area of expertise.
No	Great that is good news, I dont know much about cars
No	I have been a mechanic for many years.  What do you do for work?
No	My brother wants to be an auto mechanic.I myself are a plumber.
Yes	My two cousins are plumbers. I almost became a plumber. How do you like it?
Yes	It's pretty fun. The pay isn't great, but it keeps me busy. Decent work for now.
No	It is a very respectable job. Plumbers save more lives than doctors because they maintain public health through preventing hygiene related disease.
No	i never thought about it like that . i love your perspective !

Yes	i love shopping so much. 
Yes	I also like to go out for dinner instead of cooking and that get's expensive. You?
Yes	oh i love eating out. that is probably how i spend the most money
Yes	Do you buy drinks or just have water? I feel guilty when I go out so I try not to buy drinks though I like them.
Yes	i always get water and on the weekends i always get drinks

Yes	i work to . but i daydream so much that i forget sometimes that i've a job

Yes	What do you dream about?
Yes	When I sleep, I dream about alot of weird stuff... mostly about my fears becoming a reality. What about you?
Yes	I never remember my dreams. It's been years.
No	Oh, I see. Well that is interesting. What do you do for a living?
Yes	My day job is retail, but I took an evening gig playing piano at a local restaurant.
Yes	Fun! Ihave always wanted to learn how to play the piano but its so complicated and I am just so unmotivated in general.
No	We are planning to go to Disney World, been saving for a while. Saving money with all those coupons!
Yes	That sounds awesome! I've only ever been to Florida in order to get to Disney World. Are you there to visit family? Business? To sight-see?
Yes	Well, I make it a two-for, I see the family and do the Disney thing. Then I help my Mom at the Shelter she volunteers at.
No	Thats really sweet of you to help her out.  What type volunteer work do you help with?
Yes	Working at the Kitchen, she's inspired me to buy extra at home on sale, and to donate the overstock locally. After the kitchen though...beach time!
Yes	That sounds like fun! Beach days are the best days!

Yes	Yea, I have two also. 
Yes	i am not familiar with that what is it about?
No	It is about the people's struggle with never ending war, constant government surveillance, and public manipulation.
No	cool
Yes	It really is. It makes you think so much about police who persecute individualism and independent thinking.
Yes	i like more reading about fiction
Yes	Yes, I do also, there are good blogs where people share their opinions about books online. What fiction do you read?
No	like the laws of human nature
No	That is quite interesting.
No	it is, also like 20000 leagues under the sea

No	What are some of her biggest accomplishments?
No	She graduated from Hewlett High School and then went to the Parsons School of Design.  She was lucky enough after college to work for anne klein.

No	She was an American fashion designer. Fun fact: her birth name was actually Hannah

No	We're waiting for the first snow here. Hoping it holds off until I get home
Yes	Nothing beats when it first sets and you've got that crisp layer on top, before everyone starts walking in it.
Yes	I'm a grown adult and I still get a thrill at making fresh tracks in snow. It's like getting first crack at the new peanut butter jar.
Yes	It just makes getting home and having a nice hot dinner so much better too.
Yes	Hot stuff, though. Chili, soup...
Yes	I am an only child too, it's lonely not having siblings

Yes	I have a cat named pumpkin. He is only 9 months old.

No	Volunteer at the local hospital, bowling, even square dancing.  Mom stayed at home.  Dad worked for GE.
No	That is great, traveling is also another good thing to do with a loved one as well.
Yes	As a family we traveled from CA to NY.  Camping when we could, or staying with relatives along the way.
No	"Seems nice to just jump and just travel with a ""figure things as you go"" type deal."
Yes	Interesting, do you have a favorite composer?
Yes	I love lots of classical music artists of course, but my favorite has to be none other than Beethoven!
Yes	Can't go wrong with that. Some of my fondest memories were traveling with my dad and grandpa in the circus and them introducing me to Beethoven.
Yes	We have that in common then. I can't say the same for my wife and three kids. They get tired of hearing me play classical lol.
Yes	Haha, I only live with my two golden retrievers, so they don't have much say in the matter.
Yes	Ah, I love dogs. Used to have a golden retriever. Now we have a miniature dachshund. If they howl at the music, they like it!
Yes	"Haha, if that's the case then I guess a dogs favorite genre is ""emergency vehicle sirens"""
No	lol, maybe so. My dog seems to love the sound of a loud nearby train on that note.
No	I'm pretty fond of trains myself, I traveled on them with my family circus growing up.
No	I've only traveled by train once for an hour. My family wants to take a train vacation that goes across several states one day.
No	That's very noble of you. Animals deserve respect too.
Yes	I would like to give respect to animals too. Do you have any activist beliefs?
No	Yes, I believe in protecting the environment. We use too many wasteful products that include plastic.
Yes	And that plastic is also bad for our health too
Yes	That is very true. I read that scientists have developed a bacteria that eats plastic. Maybe it will help us clean up the oceans.
No	That would be really cool. It would be the least we could do to clean up our mess
No	It makes me very happy that you care for the environment as well. I feel that it is an important issue.
Yes	If only we could convince other people to do the same
No	People are getting there. A youtuber named MrBeast started a fundraiser to plant 20 million trees by the end of 2020.
Yes	That is interesting. 
No	I found out about it while walking along the beach. I saw her tweet out a picture with her other man. I was devastated. 
Yes	That's terrible man! What are you going to do now?
No	I don't know. I need to talk to her about it. All i've been doing now is listening to sad pop music.
Yes	oh that is terrible ! i am so sorry ! my heart goes out to you . how long were you together ?
Yes	5 whole years. I have no idea how long she's been doing this. 
No	Do you think there is any hope of saving your marriage? 5 years is a lot to give up on.
Yes	I don't know. I need to talk to her about it. She doesn't know that i know yet. Maybe we can goto counseling. 
No	That's going top be a tough conversation. I can't imagine having that talk with my wife. I hope it goes okay.
No	So for now I just need to collect my thoughts.
Yes	"I understand. Are you sure it was ,""another man""? There is no way it's just a misunderstanding?"
No	its just so dark i always felt like someone broke in and was living down there
No	There weren't any sources of light down there!?
Yes	i was too scared to even open the door to turn it on 
Yes	So you have no idea what's down there!?
No	nope no clue! i want to start traveling so i wouldnt have to worry about a basement but dont have the money
Yes	Yes, get out of there as soon as possible! You don't want to be trapped with all that stuff down there!!
Yes	i wish i could start selling my houses made of matches its a strong hobby of mine it would help with the money problem
Yes	I've never heard of that! How is it making a house with matches?
No	its very fun and relaxing actually except when you get burned by the glue gun
No	Ah, that does not sound like fun. Should I get into it?
No	I'm from Maine, You?
No	I live in CA. Right now sumbitting comic strips to publishers.
Yes	Superhero's?
Yes	Yes a whole new set. Im going to be pulishing them on the net soon.

Yes	Im super  hopeful to get a deal. Love doing this be awesome to get paid for it.
No	I can't imagine having such an enjoyable gig.
Yes	well im trying to make it work now looking for the best
No	Maybe you can make a movie if it pans out
Yes	That would be the best possible outcome. I wound be for the challenge though.
No	Sorry to hear that. I have heard four wheelers can be dangerous.
Yes	yes you have to be careful I learned the hard way ,on a slip on a hill
Yes	If that happened to me, my wife would take away my vehicle. Are you married?
Yes	No I am not , glad I am not it would be a burden on the marriage 
Yes	I understand. I get lectures from my wife all the time. Honestly I'm not afraid of what she thinks. Sometimes fun is worth an angry wife.
No	I bet you get in trouble a lot with your wife lol
Yes	Lol. She wears the pants in the family. But she makes great spaghetti so I can tolerate her.
Yes	that s so cool . spaghetti is alright that is one great meal do you garlic bread with it ?
Yes	Garlic bread and meatballs. I have to have meatballs with my spaghetti. What is your favorite food?
Yes	I like hamburgers with everything on them  
Yes	It pays the bills, ya know? It's just a part time gig for me, my main source of income is working as an insurance salesman.
No	They bought Sears for $11 BILLION... can you imagine?  
No	That's definitely insane, wouldn't have assumed it's value was anywhere near that.
No	Me either especially considering my pay for selling washers there ! lol
Yes	Haha, how do you like to de-stress after a long day of selling washers?
Yes	I like to unwind with music and a good book. You?
Yes	Pretty much the same for me, on the weekends I enjoy riding my bike through nature.
Yes	That sounds like a good way to have fun and get some exercise especially when the weather is nice out!
Yes	Definitely, helps me clear my mind after a long week in the insurance business. What kind of music do you listen to to relax?
Yes	All kinds! I love trying out new bands. 
No	Is that the one with with the yellow sponge guy?
No	No with Charlie Brown and Snoopy

No	Not that I know of.
Yes	Oh...I must be thinking of something else.  Do you play an instrument?
Yes	no, do you?
Yes	Yes, a kazoo! I also have mad skills with the tambourine.
No	lol, i used to love those.
No	It's never to late to rekindle those moments LOL a harmonica may be in your future!
Yes	those always been cool. Do you draw?
No	Yeah, I was not able to get any work done with it flying around.
Yes	My dogs four dogs are good at spotting them and trying to catch them flying around, it's pretty funny.
Yes	I bet.  That's a lot of dogs to keep fed, what kind of dogs are they?
Yes	The are all Golden Retrievers. What can I say? I love the breed. If I could spend all my time with my dogs I would.
No	That is a great breed.  How many bags of dog food to you go through a month?
Yes	Usually we go through about three huge bags. I give them human food as well, bad habit I know.
Yes	I bet they love it though.  Do they like eggs?
Yes	They do like eggs, but their favorite snack is peanut butter.
Yes	I love eggs, and breakfast in general.  Peanut butter is good too.  I think I could be a dog.
Yes	I think I could too. I could be one of my dogs at least. They have it made. Do you have pets?
No	what do you sing
No	Mostly rhymes, nickels and dimes, occasionally crimes :)
No	I enjoy working out at the gym. Sometimes I catch myself singing as I exercise.
No	That's a good way to do it. I like to do karate for exercise, but it's hard to sing while doing that. I just got my brown belt.
No	That is impressive. Do you sing for yourself or to entertain others?
No	Just for myself. I'm not good enough to sing publicly. 
No	Maybe you should try it once. I like to cook and wonde what it would be like to be on a cooking show.
No	That would be interesting. Would you do a cooking competition?
No	I think I would like to try. MOst likely I would not win, But the experience would be nice.
No	It's all about the experience!
No	He beat up his sister! I never know how to handle these situations. I don't want to use violence against violence
No	Have you considered sending him to timeout? That would be a way to punish him without being violent with him
Yes	He's a bit too old for timout. Grounding him doesn't really seem to work either
Yes	How old is he?
No	He's 14 and his sister is 12. They've really been jerks to each other lately
No	I'm sorry you're having such a hard time with them. Beating up a sibling is a serious issue. You should find a way to punish him somehow.
No	Do you have kids? I'm just not used to this kind of conflict. I was never like this with my sister growing up so I'm not sure what to do
Yes	I don't have kids. I've only got two cats. They fight, but I'm not sure that dealing with conflict among pets qualifies me to offer parenting advice. 
No	Yes, no doubt one of the best in our history 
No	I would love to play in a band someday!
No	Yes, well everything is possible you just have to put your mind to it.
Yes	true!  In my spare time I only play the guitar or sleep, so it's definitely a priority. 
No	Well if you truly want, you can, you are your only limitation.
No	You are absolutely right there.  If its truly a passion then you should go for it.  Life is too short to be stuck in a rut.
No	Yes, life is too short thats why you have to live it without regrets and as happy as you can.
No	True!  What is your passion that keeps you going/
No	My passion is my kids, I love them to death and keep me going everyday
No	You sound like a great parent, they're lucky to have you!
No	I have a Honda also.  They are great cars. 
No	they're nice cars and very fast ! My favorite was the old prelude
No	I liked those, too.  I have a Pilot now.  What kind of Honda do you have?
No	I have an accord.
No	I had two accords before my pilot.  That was nice of your dad to gift it to you.  My parents passed away. 
No	Yes. It was hold car. I do have a very unhealthy diet that consists of beer and lots of snacks.
No	Are you happy with your diet?
No	No. I would like to lose 20-30 pounds.
No	Do you exercise at all?  I like to walk, but find it hard when the weather is bad. 
No	Yes I recently joined a gym and have gone. Of course not as much as I would like.
No	Yeah I visit movie theaters sometimes when a movie takes my fancy
No	I enjoy going to the movies.  It's a lot easier than TV as I can only see 200 feet away.
No	That sounds like some weird eye sight problems.
No	Yeah, it is.  I'm hoping that surgery can help that.  What movie do you want to see when the theater opens?
No	I want to see the new Star wars movie. What about you?
No	Yes!  That's one of my favorite Christmas traditions for the past few years!
No	We have a Christmas tradition between me and my daughter she plants bulbs and seeds ready for the spring.
No	That sounds wonderful!  Definitely gives you something beautiful to look forward to!
No	For sure it does. I live in Florida so we can plant all year round.
No	I have family in Florida, I love all of the fruit trees.  The weather is wonderful!
No	No. She is harder on me than the rest of the kids because she doesn't want them to think I'm the pet
No	Oh, I see. Your mom is an angel!
No	IDK about that part. She is a nice lady, but I don't like her as a teacher she is mean.
No	i have a teacher that comes to my house to teach me as i am bedridden
No	Oh wow. Are you sick?
No	yes i have a severe sickness
No	That is bad. I will pray for you. I hope you get better.
No	thanks. i like it when my dog and cat visit me in bed
No	I do too. They are warm and snuggle with me.
No	I love when my dogs cuddle with me!
No	Well that seems a bit complicated. My daddy was a driver and he told me to rest when I am tired and drive when I'm not.
No	oh i know , i just enjoy helping people . what do you do for a living ?
No	Now I work in the truck stop mechanic shop. I don't drive any more but I love the lifestyle. I still get to talk to drivers and smell the exhaust.
No	Oh wow, that's a cool job. Do you ever get cramped up from driving? I heard some places use electric trucks now.
No	One time it took 3 months for my left hand to turn loose of the steering wheel. Had to remove it so I could pee.
No	wow , that is crazy ! that never happened to me before !
No	I gave up driving after that and marrying my sweetheart. We put a bow tie on the steering wheel at the wedding. 
No	i am genuinely happy for you.
No	Thank you kindly. How about you, you married?
No	no. I hope to though, someday
No	Hello, how long have you had braces? I have studied science myself in college. 
Yes	Ive had braces 3 years.  I have a bachelors of science degree also.  
No	That is interesting. I wanted to get braces when I was younger, but I didn't have enough money. What areas do you like in the science field?
Yes	I love psychiatry.  My kids also love science.  Braces are expensive. 
Yes	My mom is diagnose with bi-polar. I have studied a little bit of psychology. Do you have any pets?
Yes	I have 2 pets.  I rescued a dog and named him Roscoe.  Bi-polar is a scary thing.  I am sorry you have to deal with that.
No	I have rescue as well. Her name is Bell. Do you like to read?
No	I do read every once in awhile.  Do you read?  I love to read to my son. 
No	Yes, I enjoy reading. I enjoy reading about history and spirituality. I also enjoy fiction books about adventure. Do you ever bike ride?
No	Yes I do. It's really great exercise. I need a new bike.
No	I know and I am so happy that she is doing that. Do you regularly exercise?
Yes	I try to, I am actually dieting right now
No	I hope its going well for you. I actually hate running but I have to force myself if I want to stay healthy.
Yes	thanks, it's going pretty good. Yes, I walk on a treadmill, but I always feel good after
No	I'm married with kids so find it hard to go to the gym but I know what you mean about feel good afterwards. Are you married?
No	No, it's good that you can find the time with everything you have going on though
No	Its a juggle but I you're right, I have too. What type of exercise do you do?
No	For sure! Mostly the treadmill and minor weight lifting. Just running for you?
Yes	Yes running as Its the only work out that I can do where I can have some quiet time to myself before I start my day.
No	That's great to take that time for yourself, I don't run much, but it's very freeing
Yes	Very interesting! I love New York
Yes	i like new york, well atleast what i have seen in movies and tv.
No	You have to visit someday! I've been three times, it's like no other city out there.
Yes	my dad was a preacher and his church group went once, but i never did. what is your favorite part of new york?
No	That's a tough one! Either Manhattan or Brooklyn
Yes	if i were to visit where would you suggest i should go see?
Yes	I would suggest Manhattan to see Times Square as a must see. Other than that it really depends on what you like, theres something for everyone
No	it sounds like such an exciting place to be ,maybe i will go in the new year
No	What sport do you play?
Yes	I play football. My parents got me into it at a young age, but frankly I wish I could be more serious about other subjects in school
No	Well, at least your love for football got you a scholarship! That's more than a lot of people can say.
No	Very true. Too many people are not fortunate enough to acquire funding for their education/career paths
No	Exactly. College is super expensive, so any funding you can get is a blessing.
No	Yes, university has gotten so expenssive. A medical school education now costs over a hundred thousand dollars.
No	That's more than a lot of entry level medical professionals can hope to make it a year! 
No	Indeed. If the post-secondary education system could be cheaper, a lot more people would have access to their life goals
No	Very true. And a lot of people are entering college without really knowing what they want to do, thus wasting money.
No	Thats a huge issue as well. Too many people come out of high school with no practical knowledge or any idea of what they want in life
Yes	I might just have a beer!  I am kind of a couch potato right now, since school is over.  What are you doing right now?
Yes	Being a couch potato, watching a movie, lounging and enjoying a glass of wine. 
Yes	That's awesome.  I prefer beer myself.  Do you have a job right now?
Yes	I do. I work in accounting at a small family owned company. It's great! 
Yes	 I can't wait until I graduate and can start working. I'm in between jobs right now, so I just kind of sit around. What movie are you watching?
No	Stuber! Have you seen it? It is pretty hilarious! 
No	No!  I don't even know what it is about, can you tell me?
Yes	Cop goes after drug dealer. He had eye surgery and can't drive so he has to hire an UBER driver that helps him through everything. 
Yes	Sounds like fun.  I'm binge watching The Magicians, I love magic stuff.  But I always need something new to watch!
Yes	I have a few of those shows that I binge watch. Netflix is my friend! 
Yes	I spend most of my days at the computer writing. Sometimes a little boring.
Yes	I have 4 kids too so I have very little time too. With my 2 jobs and my husband they take up most of my time
No	Where do you work?  I imagine the kids keep you busy.
Yes	I work for the state doing Interior Design work.  How about you?
No	Basically just writing a novel at the present but have worked as a med tech in the past.
No	Thats cool.  I love reading novels.
No	What kind of novels do you prefer, mystery, romance??
Yes	I love romance novels.  What kind do you write?
Yes	I mainly write true crime mysteries.  Keeps my mind going.
Yes	I love true crime too.  I love crime podcast.
No	Whats your favorite Japanese food?
Yes	I guess I like any Japanese cuisine especially because seafood is common in it.
Yes	Same here. Seafood is my favorite. 
No	Seafood is amazing! Do you have a favorite seafood that you like to eat?
Yes	Scallops are probably my favorite. Or maybe king crab
Yes	King crab sounds so delicious. I have never tried those, are they similar to crawfish?
Yes	I guess it's similar but 1 king crab leg would be equivalent to like 50 crawfish
No	Yum! I think i will have to look into giving those a try
Yes	You definitely should. They're expensive so I don't eat it often
Yes	Most seafood is costly. I usually eat at my local mall food court during a shopping break and they have so much to choose from
No	Ouch. Wow. I suppose that is true though
No	Yes, we need to start teaching about this from a young age in schools.
No	Yea, maybe they wont do it in the future
No	That's probably true, but who knows in this country.
No	Honestly, history seems to repeat itself here anyway
No	i agree . another thing we can do to fix the world we live in .
No	Yea, kids are the future I guesss
No	i guess you are right 
No	right? and here we are!! tomorrow flying cars...I hope so and I'd love to work on them! I hate my job...
No	Do you think self-driving cars would help?  Those would be fun to work on also!
No	Well, not so sure about that, after that crazy crash with Tesla. But, i'd love to explore alternate transportation options...Beam me up!
No	Indeed, Elon Musk is a genius though, Hes made the Tesla Powerwall, Powerpack batteries, solar panels and solar roof tiles for people all over the world.
No	Agree totally...and we need to be collectively and seriously exploring all options away from fossil fuel without a doubt.
No	What do you think about solar? I hope we can pave the planet with panels someday!
No	Solar is a great option, but also worry about the balance of nature vs technology. Its all about balance
No	I see, how do you think we can balance technology with our lives?
No	"Envision this, ""This used to be Yellowstone National Park, but now every living tree and plant has been removed to be a monstrous solar field""...ugh"
No	I can see your point, it is definitely a balancing act!@
Yes	Thanks, I really appreciate that. I would love to just go away and ride my bike to the beach right now.
Yes	That sounds relaxing. The beach always makes me feel happy. 
No	What is your favorite thing about the beach?
Yes	I love the sound of the waves crashing, the sunshine, and my feet in the sand.
No	Those are all my favorites too. I spend more time in the sand than the water..that's for sure.
No	The water can be chilly and you never know whats going to be in it either. Sometimes its pretty gross...
No	I agree. Sometimes I get the urge to body surf, but I'd rather lay on the beach and soak in the rays.
Yes	My dog enjoys the sand, I like to walk him on the beach. But he likes splashing around in the water alot 
Yes	That's so fun though! I should really get a dog to come on those kind of adventures with me.
No	You definitely should! Its so much fun having a buddy to travel around with you. 
Yes	it sure is. It all happens so fast! my kid is already talking in her sleep and enjoys folk metal just like her dad!
No	That is awesome. Your kiddo will be talking your ear off in no time.
No	oh yeah, tell me about it. How long did you guys wait before having your kid?
Yes	We waited 3 years. 
No	That's a long time. Ours was a surprise. But hey, it happens. Does it get harder when they become teens? 
Yes	Jenny's been moodier in her teens, but she's a good kid. William will be 13 next year 
Yes	Two teens. yikes. Well it's good that they're close in age. I'm 10 years older than my sister. We aren't close
Yes	I really enjoyed growing up with a brother and sister that were close to my age. I was excited that my kids could have that same experience
No	We want the same for our daughter. Hopefully it will be easy to have another. we are getting older
No	are y'all trying for another baby yet?
No	That sounds to scary for me, I can't deal with serial killer stuff
No	It's a little scary sometimes but i like to see the reality of which we live
No	That is true, you should shield yourself from everything bad out there
No	I guess. What do you like to do
Yes	I usually like to watch documentaries, its really easy to get lost in all the information.
No	Yeah it is lol i think some are boring thiugh
No	Oh some definitely are, Just have to find the right topic of where your interests are.
No	true. what topics do you like most
Yes	I usually go for war, sports, and the occasional one about a company
No	That's cool. It's nice to have these things
No	No i haven't. What is it about?
No	It helps you create JavaScript applications. We use it at the school where I'm a teacher.
Yes	I enjoy creating websites but havent heard about it
No	It is pretty easy to use, you should look into it! Do you create websites for work?
Yes	No, I do them for myself
No	Oh, nice! I've been wanting to build my own website, but I've been going through a hard time and it's taking all my energy.
Yes	I've been doing a lot of things for myself lately. I want to start investing money
No	Really, what is a good place to invest money?
No	I don't know. I just started to do some research
Yes	Well, I guess I have plenty of time to do my own research, now that I'm single. I wish you luck in your investments! 
Yes	I have two older half brothers, one younger half brother, and a younger half sister. 
Yes	I have three older siblings. Do you wish you were an only child?
Yes	Well I consider myself an only child actually, because I never lived with my siblings. I hated it to be honest. It was lonely.
Yes	Your parents should have gotten you a pet. I had a dog and it was wonderful.
Yes	Fortunately we almost always had a dog. That did help a lot for sure. I began working online as a side gig recently and my dog keeps me company.
Yes	That's great, what kind of side gig? I'm doing something similar right now.
Yes	I have two actually. One of them I go places, take pictures, and answer questions. I eat meat so it's good they have pizza mystery shopping.
No	That sounds fun. Does it pay well?
Yes	Certain ones really do. It follows your location if you want it too, so when traveling, I do jobs along the way and pay for gas or the trip itself!
Yes	How nice. I could use some supplemental income.
Yes	I didn't know that! Do you like to cook?
Yes	Cooking is my favorite. I can whip up just about anything!
Yes	I like cooking too! I really enjoy shopping for cooking items online!
Yes	What's your favorite meal to make?
Yes	Pasta! I usually cook a very tasty pasta for myself and then, I enjoy it while reading fantasy books
Yes	I never have time to read because I'm busy working in architecture 
No	Oh that's too bad! You could try to listen to audiobooks!
Yes	That's definitely a good idea. Any book recommendation?
Yes	Have you ever read any Lord of the Ring books? They are amazing!
Yes	No I haven't I've heard great things about them though.
No	No, it is a dog.
Yes	Oh, dogs are fun. I don't have any animals. I'm too busy working all the time and raising my daughter. 
No	I can understand that.  How old is your daughter?
Yes	18. She just graduated high school. So proud of her, she was at the top of her class. 
Yes	That's awesome.  When I graduated my parents sent me on a trip to backpack in the forests of California.
No	oh, that seems like fun! Why California? 
No	Because I had never been that far west.  Have you been to California?
Yes	No, I stay pretty close to home. 
Yes	Gotcha.  Forests are my favorites.  I go as often as I can.
No	Do you ever go hiking with your sister's dog in forests?
No	I am always looking for new places.
Yes	Yes I like to try out different spots to eat there is a new one in are town I have not got to eat there yet 
No	Does it have good reviews?
No	Yes and they seem to busy when ever I go past the place I can not think of the name of it right now it is a Italian Restaurant 
No	There are so many good Italian Restaurants. 
No	Some told me the place that I was  talking about was expensive 
No	I would bet. If it's authentic, it will always cost more.
Yes	Most places like that are. I like to get 5.00 pizzas sometimes to save some money 
No	Absolutely no problem with that. I do the same.
No	I think you can to them if you want more on them , most of the time it is good the way it is
No	You know a lot about fishes, what is your job?
Yes	I am an aquarium builder, it's a passion:)
Yes	Great, must be really nice job working at aquarium. I'm a graphic designer.
Yes	I always wish I was good at design. I've tried, but I'm pretty garbage, haha!
Yes	I've never been really talented too, I've just wanted to be designer so I've worked hard on myself and learned a lot of things.
No	I've always believed hard work equals talent if you have the passion. It sounds like you have plenty of it. 
No	I believe in that too! Thanks, It's great to hear something like this.
Yes	I never thought I would be doing what I am. I certainly didn't know much about it. But through work and research I'm doing what I love. 
No	I've read a great quote today...Do what you love and you will never work a day in your life.
No	For sure, that is a motto to live by! I wouldn't dream of doing anything different.
Yes	yea but they moved away im in springfield mo so not much here
No	Im sorry.. I moved once from MD to FL so I know how you feel being without your peeps.
Yes	yeah i just bought a house here actually i love it its nice and peaceful but they wanted to move somewhere bigger
Yes	Thats awesome! I like smaller houses in my personal opinion. As long as there is plenty of sun shining through the windows. 
Yes	yes i agree its actually a tiny house but just enough room for me
No	Tiny houses are very popular at the moment, at least yours isnt 96 sq. feet or smaller. haha
No	yes they are in my opinion you a house can be too tiny haha
Yes	indeed ! at least i have my cat do you have animals ?
Yes	i also have a cat its a calico whats yours? 
No	I love calico cats.  There two colored coats are so pretty.
No	I'm thinking of taking a year off myself to find some work. Really needing to get my first car. Taking the bus everywhere is terrible!
No	Public transportation is better for the planet and gives you time to read though.  It is hard to do some things though.
Yes	I agree completely about the benefits but it is hard when it comes to going longer distances.
No	That's true. It's also hard to do shopping.
Yes	Exactly! I use the delivery services through Walmart for shopping mostly though. My contribution to the environment.
Yes	Do you like to read on the bus? I take the bus to class and read comics.
Yes	I'm a huge comic and manga fan. I always bring one with me. What's your favorite?
Yes	I collect old New Mutants from the Claremont and Simonson runs, but I've been reading Whiteout lately.
Yes	I've heard Whiteout was a good read. Would you recommend getting into it?
No	Yeah. Rucka and Leiber are very good. I also really like the Katie Cook MLP run.
No	absolutley , I feel the best candidates are those that you can learn from.
Yes	I completely agree. How old are you? I'm 25
Yes	I am 33

Yes	I've been considering picking up martial arts to protect myself when I go to the store. 
Yes	That sounds fun! I would like to practice outside.
Yes	Yeah...I've been looking for some krav maga classes near my house. I'm not sure if they train outside or inside though. 
No	I don't know what krav maga is. It sounds really fun, though.
Yes	I freelance, so it varies quite a bit. On a good year I'm on the six figure fringe.
Yes	Wow, that's awesome. For my job, I help build cars. I love my job, but it only makes 30k per year.
No	Nothing wrong with that, the most important thing is whether or not it's something you're passionate about and enjoy doing.
Yes	That's true, for sure. I have met many people who made a lot that did not seem happy or who did not enjoy their jobs.
Yes	Yeah, freelancing suits me pretty well. I have a hard time sitting still so being able to bounce around and do whatever feels right is nice. 
Yes	I rather like having a predictable schedule but it is certainly not for everyone. What is your side gig?
Yes	I like finding old cars and restoring them and then selling them. Although sometimes I fall in love with the old junky ones and end up keeping them myself
Yes	That sounds similar to what my friend does flipping houses. He loves his job and it sounds like you do too!
Yes	Yeah, it's pretty rewarding and I really enjoy it. Have you ever considered a side gig?
Yes	I actually have a side gig where I go to various places taking pictures for a company and answer questions and they pay me. It's fun.
Yes	I will, and will pass it down.
No	Your children will love to have it one day.
No	Yes hopefully i can find someone to fix it. 
No	Oh, what is wrong with it?
Yes	It has holes.
No	That's no good! I hope it is not too costly to fix.
No	Maybe i can fix it with patches.
No	Patches would work. It could even add some unique character to the quilt.
No	That is what i was thinking, what kind of material should i use?
No	I would try to material that is similar to the quilt. I know fabric stores have many fabric samples.
No	I didn't know that, doesn't he also hold the record for the backstroke?
No	Yes, he shows off this ability at local shows
No	Do you know the next time he'll do a show near me?
No	There's a good chance of that, if you live in a big city!
No	I kind of do, it's the biggest in the state of AR but it's not, like, chicago or anything
Yes	Well do you have any olympic size swimming pools there?
No	I... actually have no idea. If there is, I don't know where it is.
No	Well I hope he does a show near you. Have you heard of Wilm Hof?
Yes	I'm actually not legally married to my husband (though I call him that). We are common-law partners.  Doesn't bother me but I'm sure it would bug some people.
No	I haven't managed to find anyone yet, but I think as long as your in love, your legal status doesn't matter
No	Agreed.  For us, marriage just seemed like a waste of money--you can do a lot more exciting things with that amount!
Yes	Yes, you can! What do you guys like to do together?
No	We play video games, watch movies. He's a lot more athletic than I am, but I try to join him on hikes when I can.

No	Oh, me too!  I'm a night owl and I hate getting up early in the morning.
No	Mornings are the worse! I've been trying to find a night job so I can sleep all day.
Yes	I did that through a lot of university!  What do you like to do for fun?
No	Mostly watching tv. I haven't found any good shows lately. 
No	How long has Barbie Girl been out?
No	Probably at least 30 years
Yes	Oh wow, I am behind the times, most of my time is taken up taking care of my son, he was born blind. 
No	oh no! that is awful. how old is he?
No	he is 12, you know it was awful to find out, but he is an exceptional kid, and it is true that your other senses become heigthened
Yes	Oh wow. Does he like music?
Yes	He does love music, he is taking guitar lessons right now, he loves it.
Yes	That is really cool I think I want to learn how to play the guitar.
No	You should try it, it can be a great stress releaver
No	do you have any hobbies?
No	What shows are you watching right now?
No	The Godfather, I have it on dvd

No	I don't really have a favorite. How about you?
Yes	Probably Vince Vaughn. I like a lot of his movies
No	Ohh, Vince Vaughn does have some very good acting skills and great shows
Yes	I keep it at a boatyard. I have my own boat too, it makes it possible to fish for snowcrab. 
Yes	That's nice! I've been wanting to start oystering, but I'm have a baby, for the second time around. I don't think a boat would be my friend.
No	Oh my word! Congratulations! I eat a lot of oysters, I love eating all sorts of seafood. 
Yes	Thank you, we're getting excited! I am a vegetarian who only eats oysters. That seems funny when I say it out loud!
No	Ha ha! People that only eat fish meat are called pescatarians. But does that include oysters? I am not sure. 
No	Lol, I'm not sure either! Labels can be confusing. I'm an artist so I just try to roll with it:)
Yes	Wow, what kind of artist are you? I love to paint fish and the sea but I am not so skilled. 
Yes	I am a photographer, my mentor is Sally Mann! Most of my pieces are on landscapes and people, the capturing of the soul. I love that you paint!
Yes	Oh, a photographer, I see. I am not familiar with Sally Mann unfortunately. I will look for her instagram. But yes, I love to finger paint, it relaxes me.
Yes	Yes, do look into her, you won't regret it. Wow! Finger painting, now that's a technique I haven't thought about for quite some time! So cool:)
Yes	I will have to try to remember my instagram password, haha! Yes, I love to finger paint, and do full body paintings, but it uses a lot of paint.
Yes	Totally, we have too many passwords to remember!! How much does it cost you to do a full body painting?
Yes	It absolutely is and I love watching Grey's Anatomy. How about you?
Yes	I do. Most would probably think I'm strange cause I know so much about the show, along with that I have orange and blue hair lol.
No	Lol that is funny. I can't live with out it honestly it's apart of my every day life. I live by a schedule to stay sane lol.
Yes	I would like to live more by a set schedule, but my 3-year-old makes that difficult lol
No	Lol I can really relate kids are adorable and they definitely keep you on your toes.
Yes	That they do. I'm enjoying my daughter and hoping to have one more child in the next couple of years. I dread their teenage years though.
No	I can say the teenage years are scary let me tell you
No	Oh I'm sure. They were scary enough for me when I was a teenager. Things are so different these days from 20 years ago!
No	Yes it is and it's so sad to say the least
No	That it is. We spent most of our time outdoors and now they all live in their phones moreso than anywhere else. Sigh. 
No	Ugh. I completely agree and just think Grey's Anatomy will be a thing of the past.
No	I dread the day when it is. Hopefully Netflix and other outlets like cable TV will keep it alive like they did some other shows like The Andy Griffith Show.
No	I do workout, I love wearing name brand like Nike to make me feel powerful
No	Nike is great for sure. I've been impressed with Adidas lately too
Yes	I was asked to play professionally with a womans basketball team, I was so excited
No	That's so cool. Do you still play?
Yes	These knees can not longer bend like they used too, I just mentor when I can
No	That's unfortunate. DO you follow the WNBA?
No	I do follow it, it has changed so much over the years, better for women now and more notoriety
No	I'm not the biggest basketball fan but I like watching some college and March Madness for sure
No	That sounds like an excuse to have a wing and nacho party in the mix while watching
No	And fill out tournament brackets...
Yes	No. I just love gospel music because I hear it a lot in church. my father was a preacher so I grew up with it
No	I am a musician, gospel music is great.

Yes	I prefer folk music, i play the violin. 
No	Do you have any favorite movies?
Yes	Yes i like superhero movies. What sort of movies do you like?
Yes	I enjoy drama movies. My favorite is last of the Mohicans
No	Oh yes, that is a good movie! 
No	What is your favorite movie?
Yes	I enjoyed the Marvel Universe movies, i liked the way they all join up. 
Yes	For sure. I'm not one to have many friends at once, so working in the museum is perfect for me. It's quiet and I meet a lot of people.
Yes	Yeah.  Lots of historical signifigance there.  Like DEaly plaza where JFK was killed.  Conspiracy nuts love it.
Yes	My favorites are natural history museums. I have a keen interest in animals and nature in general.
Yes	I like Green museums. The help people be more conscious of their world and it's limitations and how their actions affect it.
No	Those are nice too! You sound like you know your way around museums yourself.
Yes	yes a few . i like to visit museums for inspirations sometimes .
No	What are some of your other hobbies or interests?
Yes	I like visiting art museums. State and local art museums are similar but where they differ is the collection itself.
No	Ah yes, city museums, especially those in smaller cities or towns, are easily overlooked. Many hidden gems out there.
No	Yea they even have artifact galleries you can look at.
No	That sounds like it would make a cool little comic.
No	Yeah it would, since the chello is one of the least popular choices of instruments for children.
No	Wonder why they don't like it as much?
Yes	Well since my mother taught me, I really didn't have a choice. The kids at the Y tease me about it.
Yes	Oh I'm sorry to hear that. I also get picked on about reading comic books and wanting to be a super hero.
No	Which super hero do you aspire to be?
Yes	It has always been the character Vampirella.
Yes	That sounds interesting.Tomorrow I will have to share that at the Y. A mixture of vampires and Cinderella is an awesome topic for the pool.
No	Lol true! What sport do you participate in at the Y?
Yes	I participate in swimming every day. It takes an every day attempt to get me over my fear of drowning.
No	i know that you are going to take lots of pics. are you going with family?
No	Yes, with my brother. We like to take adventure trips together a couple of times a year when classes allow.
No	that is so cool! who is older?
No	I am 8 years older. I'm 18 years older than my sister. Mom liked to spread it out I guess. lol
Yes	that is really cool that you like to spend time with your family.  how long do you two plan to spend at winter the dolphin?
No	Just a day or 2. Then we are off to the Don Cesar in St.Petersburg. Have you ever heard of it?
No	no! i haven't sounds luxurious.  is it a five-star hotel?
No	Yes it is. It's really old and looks like a giant pink stucco castle, but it's fabulous inside. Great way to finish the trip.
Yes	sounds amazing! what type of architecture do you think they based it on?
Yes	I'm not sure, but it looks like it's old Spanish style architecture. Do you know a lot about architecture?
No	Singing in the shower is the best.
No	Shower beers are also the best
No	I've never had alcohol actually. Whats it like?
Yes	Depends how much you drink I guess!
No	what about enough to get, as they say, wasted?
Yes	Have a lot of fun and then pay for it the next day when you feel horrible
No	Sounds like a bad choice if you leave without someone.
No	Yea you should be safe about drinking for sure
No	I always hear that. 
No	I guess that applies to anything though
No	I was running late for work. 
No	Even if you're late it's still dangerous to do that, you should be careful! Have you ever been in a car crash?
Yes	Only once, but my brother was driving. Never as the driver!
Yes	They are very scary, I was hit by a driver who jumped a red light. Broke my legs and one arm. It was horrible
No	That sounds horrible. I hope you were able to recover completely and have no permanant issues. 
Yes	Sadly not, don't have full movement in one arm and I still walk with a limp as my leg never healed properly. Happy to be alive though!
No	Yes, better than the alternative. I see scary wrecks all the time and i cringe. I lost a good friend in a motorcycle accident.
No	I'm sorry to hear that. Do you ride motorcycles? I'm too scared
Yes	No I am too scared also. My brother had one for a while. I was so happy when he sold it.
No	I bet, my friend is a doctor, in th ER they call them donorcycles
No	Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Yes	I have two sisters! One older one younger.
Yes	I have 5 brothers and sisters. 4 brothers passed away and I have sister that is left
No	Thats sad. I guess even with them gone you still had them once
No	Do you go to church?
Yes	I use to go to church when I was little, not any more.
No	Why did you stop going?
Yes	It just didn't seem to help you know. Do you go?
Yes	 Barely.  I dont know if there is a God or not.
No	I guess going to church doesnt mean there is or isnt.
Yes	i love to read because it is easier to gain knowledge through literature since you can interpret the words how you want
Yes	I enjoy reading as well it takes me to a new world.
No	people also have a habit of allowing their biases to show through when speaking to one another. even teachers do it
Yes	Everyone should be allowed to think for themselves without all the outside influences.
No	i completely agree. having the information is vital but i think its more important to have objective, factual information first to form your own opinion
No	I definitely agree with you on that.
No	it's actually insane how people can teach children things and skew their entire world view.
No	Yes, that is very true people try and shape young minds to fit their beliefs.
No	i think that's part of why being a parent today is how hard, especially when so much of the world is still unconscious
Yes	The world is so much different now than when I was a kid being a parent would be hard.
No	If I do win, I may have to share the winnings with my Reddit family as I post there a lot.
No	Yeah, people do like impulse spending that comes with wagering money.
Yes	And honestly, that would be me. I'd have to buy a new car that was blue because I LOVE the color blue.
No	What kind of car would you get, what would be your dream car?
Yes	Probably an Aston Martin Vanquish because James Bond drives it. But instead of silver, I'd have to have a blue one. lol
Yes	That's a very nice car! Yeah, that's something I would get too.
Yes	I know it sounds crazy, but I'm obsessed with the color blue. Like, I only like Facebook because they use the color blue.
Yes	Haha, my shirt is kind of blue, i guess it is a really cool and versatile color. Reminds me of Sonic the Hedgehog
Yes	Indeed it does! Makes me miss that old game. I guess his color was why I loved it so much!
Yes	Yeah! I love video games myself, i design them for a living. 
Yes	I grew up in Mississippi so I am used to it being hot
Yes	I understand that, usually in cold whether I stay in home watching YouTube videos
No	What kind do you like to watch
Yes	Mostly gaming videos and movies trailers you know
No	Do you play any video games yourself or do you just enjoy watching them
Yes	Kinda bit of both, sometimes I write on my spare time
No	That sounds interesting. How did you get into that?
Yes	Basically just thoughts that pop up in my head and I write them down
Yes	The most writing that I do is making a note in my iPhone and then forgetting about it for 5 months. 
Yes	Its like this, when I have a lot of stuff written down I revise them to see if I can make a story out of it
Yes	I have 2 golden retrievers. What type of dogs do you have?
Yes	I have a Husky and a maltese Shiz Tzu. They are my little babies!
Yes	Aww, I bet they are gorgeous! My parents love my pets too and treat them like grandkids. haha.
Yes	Mine too! They are definitely loved and treated like our kids by the whole family. How long have you had your babies?
Yes	I have had mine for 3 years? Do you enjoy dressing them up for Halloween?
Yes	Oh yes! This year they will be dressed up as Count Dracula and Mrs. Dracula. I cant wait! do you dress them up on halloween?
Yes	I dressed mine up as clowns last years as a tribute to my father and grandfather who worked for a circus! Fun theme.
Yes	How fun! I am thinking about dressing up as a bat to match my babies Dracula theme!
No	Aww, that is a great idea. I am still thinking about this year. There are so many ideas that I love. Any suggestons?
No	Not really, there are cute ideas on the internet. I would try looking there
No	Really?  That sounds fascinating.
No	It can be difficult sometimes but he seems to enjoys it.
Yes	That comes along with the job.  I am also an attorney.
No	That is a powerful type of position, is it difficult?
No	It can be.  Lots of details to remember.  But it is never boring.
Yes	i just work with individuals . i enjoy working with the elderly most .
No	Are you in a private practice?
Yes	I do a little of both.
No	That sounds like a lot going on!
No	It can be sometimes, what are your hobbies?
No	now people who throw tailgate parties are fanatics about football. who is your favorite football team?
Yes	I like the Eagles. What about you?
No	sad to say, i am not into sports. but if i was into sports, my college team would be bama and my pro team would be the cowboys
No	so you've never been tailgating then?
Yes	no ... i am one of those homebodies who gets a thrill out of netflix, a cup of hot peppermint tea and a good book.
Yes	Binge watching is a hell of a lot better than binge drinking, that's alcoholism in a nutshell. My favorite Netflix show is Ozarks
Yes	lol ... mine is  .... (in my whisper voice) lucifer.  i was raised in a strict christian household. lol!
No	never seen it before but i've heard good things
No	it is insanely crazy. if it is not against your moral aptitude, you should watch it. lol. it was great chatting with you. have a good one!
No	will do! nice chatting
No	My brownies! Ugh, the kitchen smells horrible now haha
No	Oh no! Do you burn foods often?
No	No, hardly ever! I'm a great cook but not the best at baking. Maybe I should just stick to writing. Aspiring journalist here
No	Very lucrative career. What do you write about?
No	Generally politics. I am fascinated by what motivates politicians to do the outlandish things they do.
No	I'm more of a fan of the past than the present. I like the Victorian era.
Yes	My mom is a librarian, I grew up in a home that was more focused on fiction and the past. I'm more interested in here and now
Yes	My mom owned a doll store. I collect them now. My favorite is a doll that looks like Queen Victoria.
No	I could understand your love for history in that case. That's more interesting than some of the boring things she would read to us kids haha
No	What books would she read to you?
No	What are you favorite fillings or toppings for tacos?
Yes	 I love chicken and chorizo with sour cream, cilantro, and onion
Yes	That sounds good, minus the cilantro. I am not a fan of it.
No	that is too bad ! ! you are missing out !
Yes	So I've been told. I can tolerate it in some salsas, but only freshly made ones.
No	Fresh made salsa is the only way to go! Do you like any other Hispanic food?
Yes	I enjoy most anything that comes in a tortilla, or can be eaten with a tortilla. Especially taquitos
Yes	Me too! I love tortas, quesadillas, and horchata!
No	Oh, quesadillas, I somehow forgot about those. A local restaurant makes the best ones.
No	Do you like food trucks?
Yes	My older brother plays in the NFL. I worry every time he's out there, but I know he's doing what he loves.
No	He is a professional I'm sure he will be alright.
No	All the head trauma controversy is making me nervous; sometimes you don't know you were effected until much later in life.
No	You see this happen with hockey, players being affected well into the retirement.
Yes	I like to watch hockey, but I am not very knowledgeable about the sport in general.
Yes	I like the action, although I have been distracted lately, I keep thinking about the lovely Rita Hayworth
No	She definitely is an icon, but that's a pretty random choice. Did you watch one of her movies recently?
Yes	I was black and white older movies and she caught my eye. 
No	She was a beautiful dancer as well as a great actress.
Yes	I would love to dance with her in the rain. It sounds romantic. What do you think? Am I crazy?
Yes	Oh yeah they are. Finally after years of hard work they have a place they own.
No	Ever thought about traveling to celebrate such occasion? Maybe you can join me to see the pyramids.
No	Seems like a strange thing to ask. But no, I personally cannot afford to go on big trips out of the country.
Yes	That's fair. How close are you with your sister?
Yes	Were pretty close, I talk to her a few times a month but she lives out of state so.
No	Oh. Perhaps you can go visit her and visit that new place. Does their new place have a pool?
No	Yeah, I might go sometime in a few months when I save up some cash, No theres no pool but its really close to some cool hiking trails
No	Oh nice. Yes traveling cost must be quite hefty. Are you into hiking? 
No	Yes! I really enjoy hiking, spending hours in nature.
Yes	That must be fun. I wish I can enjoy it as much as you do. When was the last time you went on a hike?
Yes	Oh wow, I drive up there all the time with work - beautiful part of the world!
Yes	definately ! star trek is a classic favorite of mine since childhood .
No	Yeah it's really good, although I have to say I do prefer the films...
Yes	I like the films but I love watching the series with my mom at home. Which Star Trek film is your favorite?
Yes	I think it would have to be the Wrath of Khan. How about you?
Yes	"I have never seen it but I really enjoyed ""Into Darkness"", one of the latest movie. Have you seen it?"
Yes	Yes I did like it, although a little to 'Hollywood'y for my tastes!
Yes	I agree with you on that. Movies like that always make me think on how scary the future might be one day. Do you feel the same way?
Yes	Yeah absolutely, although the future is already here - the truck I drive already feels like a space ship with all the new technology!
Yes	i never thought about it like that . i love your perspective !
Yes	I love dogs too but my wife and I have 3 cats now.
Yes	I love cats. I have 2. Do you plan to get a dog?
Yes	Cool!  No, my wife kind of wants one but at my age I can no longer deal with losing pets.
Yes	Yes losing them is so hard. I lost a cat last year. 
Yes	So sorry.  Yes, we lost a cat not too long ago.  He kind of took especially to me.  I still miss him so badly.
No	I bet. Here too. What do you like to do when you are not home with your cats?
Yes	I fly RC aircraft.  Mostly planes, but helicopters as well and recently getting into FPV quadcopters.
No	That is very cool. I have a friend who has an RC plane airport area. I like hobby RC cars. I have 2 and they are very fast.
Yes	Cool!  I have a friend that used to run RC trucks.  I like music as well and am currently building a cigar box guitar.
No	I love music too. Do you play the guitar?
No	no i did not know that. i do like homer simpson as well as bart.
No	What else do you like? One of my friends is obssessed with south park

Yes	hes pretty cool. cartman has some issues that could be adressed
Yes	My favourite is kenny honestly 
No	yeah i feel sorry for him some times.
No	he dies more than the dudes from supernatural 
No	Have you ever seen them live?
No	Unfortunately not , money is tight at the moment ! Itâ€™s a massive dream of mine however !  
No	It's crazy and worth it for sure! I've only seen them once in Nashville but I'd say it was the best show I've ever been to.
No	Wow that sounds great , must be a really exhilarating experience, congratulations! Planning on seeing anyone else in the future ?
No	I do plan on going to Washington DC on New Years to see Skrillex. Different genre but still a good show!
No	What thatâ€™s amazing , although my favourite DJ is marshmello 
Yes	I love Marshmello! I got to see him at EDC and he put on a great show.
Yes	Youâ€™ve seen a lot , how many concerts have you actually been to ?
Yes	Honestly hard to say but I would guess 200+ if you included all the acts at festivals ect.
Yes	Iâ€™ve been some at the local club , whatâ€™s the best concert youâ€™ve ever been to ?
No	they were honking at me and flashing their brights, wasnt till i pulled over a noticed a tail light out
No	ohhhh okay that makes more sense. It's hard to communicate between drivers without misunderstandings. 
No	this is true if only there was a way to better communicate on the road
No	Maybe someone will invent some gadget one day to help! Were you going anywhere fun when you were honked at?
No	Maybe they will. not only was tail light out bad weather was just 5 mins away
No	Oh my gosh! Glad you're ok. We recently had tornadoes here.
No	Thanks, and glad you are ok from the tornadoes. Weather can get nasty
No	Let's discuss something more pleasant. Any upcoming vacation plans?
No	Well I was heading up north since the weather was getting cold, love the snow!
No	I would love some snow right now lol. Do you ski or snowboard?
Yes	I am a snakeskin oil salesman, could I interest you in a tonic?
No	What kind of tonic are you offering?
No	It helps with hair growth, increases brain performance, and brings good luck. Just 5 payments of 9.99
No	Wow, that's 3 great things in one!  Is the fee negotiable?
No	Yes, absolutely. I stare at people from a distance. That is my idea of how to flirt. How about you?
No	No, that's kind of creepy.  How about $5.00?
No	I get that a lot. For you I will do 4.99. I will throw in 10 shamwows if you pay the shipping and handling.
No	What is a shamwow?
No	It is a legendary towel made popular by a television salesman. It is super absorbent. 
No	Sounds great, I bet I could re-sell it for 3 easy payments of $9.99.
No	What agricultural zone do you live in? I'm afraid the frost would kill them in my area.
Yes	I live up north actually, so I am only able to garden in the summer months. Its a short season!
Yes	I live in the south, so if you have good luck growing strawberries up north, it sounds like I should have no problem.
No	It should be easy!  It grows quick and you can consume them in large quantities.  Strawberries are super delicious with chocolate.
No	That's a great idea! I think chocolate strawberries and a night on the beach are an example of a perfect day for me.
No	that sounds like a great combination .
No	What is your idea of a perfect day?
Yes	I like to kayak - so any day I can get out on the water is a perfect day to me!
Yes	Fishing from a kayak is one of my favorite things to do. Especially in the evening.
No	Do you own your own kayak or do you rent?
No	oh do they, thats cool!
No	What kind of dog have you been thinking about?

No	They were really mad, yeah. I just told them that I fell asleep because I wanted to be ready for my flight to iceland
No	did you miss your flight?
Yes	No, I almost did though. I was practicing my cursive but I was just so bored I guess I fell asleep.
No	Practicing cursive? I thought everyone stopped using that.
Yes	They did, but I just really want to learn It's hopeless though because I do not understand how people can do that.
No	are you left handed or right handed?
Yes	I'm right handed, but trying to learn cursive with my left
No	sounds like you like torturing yourself.
Yes	Nah, I just want t olearn cursive becausse arrparently it's popular in Iceland and I have always wanted to live there.
No	Iceland looks nice but it's too cold for me.
No	Umm not really I'm not into landscaping but where I live there is 2 major landscaping companies so I pass them on my late night walks. 
Yes	that sounds great, i went to art school but i appreciate a good lawn
Yes	I have to agree with you there. Who wants a nice house but the lawn is crappy lol. What's your favorite food to eat for me I loveee Pizza!!!

Yes	Oh yes I can go to town for some BBQ. Especially some good smoked ribs with some great sauce to top it.

No	Wow what formats

No	I actually got into it fairly late. I was more into track and rowing in high school. What kind of dancing do you do?
Yes	i like 2 step. Rowing how many people are on a team?
Yes	When I rowed in high school, it was eight people to a boat. Not sure if college or other levels are different
Yes	I have seen it on TV before. It looks like a lot of work. Do you like the karate class you started?
No	Love it. We operate through a local group that provides leadership training for city kids. The kids have such drive and focus, it's great to see their skills develop
No	working with kids is so much fun. It is grate you are helping them develop skills. Do you help out in other local groups?
No	Yeah, I work my city's community garden group to support urban permaculture -- basically, parks full of free food. How about you? What's your jam?
No	Next week!
No	Good luck in your studying! what is the test on?
No	It is a composite of the many skills required for putting on a show.
Yes	oh wow! that sounds interesting! last time I took a test I was almost late as my car broke down!   
Yes	Wow almost a bummer. I get confused between my studying for the test and for my show sometimes.
Yes	Yeah I got an old car from my dad that kept breaking down when I was in college! Are you singing in the show?
Yes	Why yes as well as dancing too. Do you have a better car now?
Yes	That sounds fun! I used to do a bit of musical performance when I was younger. I have the same car actually but I don't drive as often now.
Yes	Oh, I drive a lot to put on my show and the hamburgers I eat keep me going. Are you living in a city then with mass transit?
Yes	I also love hamburgers, I probably eat far too much lol. Yeah I use buses and trams to get around now mainly.
Yes	Its so rare here in NYC for people to hold doors! Ive been here a month I'm a freshman at NYU
No	Do you like it there how has it been for you so far?
Yes	Its great, just adjusting to city life. My three older sisters went here too, Im the youngest...they set the tradition! lol
No	That is awesome I have never been what is your favorite thing about it?
Yes	It's true what they say, it's a city that never sleeps. The art, culture and of course 24/7 FOOD! Such great Italian near by!
No	What is the best restaurant there. I love pizza and have always heard it was good.
Yes	I personally love John's of Bleeker Street. It's just delicious and I love anchovies!! I know, I know...gross right? lol
No	That is gross I couldn't imagine eating that at all let alone on a pizza!
Yes	Well, albeit, they are slimy and microboned, they just add an incredibly salty little zip on top of those cured meats, sauce and cheese...YUM! What Pizza do you like best?
No	I like the chicago style stuffed from papa murphys it has all the good stuff!
No	mmm, that sounds very good right about now
No	cheesecake is my favorite ! cheesecake foredays

Yes	hmmm bring it all! whats your favorite?
No	I am based in chicago, so i like Eli's Cheesecake
Yes	I want to change though. I know I can be selfish at times, and weak.
No	"how were you being ""Selfish"""
No	I put my needs ahead of my boyfriend's and now my heart is broken :(
No	well things take time i wouldnt say change youll find someone that loves you for you
No	I appreciate the kind words, thank you. I still feel motivated to change and I hope I can over time

No	Nothing quite like them on the market.  So what music are you into?
Yes	I love all music, I flip flog a lot currently I am listening to country top hits. You?
Yes	Huge country fan.  Lliving in Alabama (yes I do), that's about all you can hear.  Unfortunately, I like the old school, twangy stuff.  It's coming back though.
Yes	I like in MO, on a cattle farm, so goes hand in hand, lol! Some of the new stuff doesn't sound like country at all!
No	yes , i'm sure many would agree with that . the new country is more like pop .
No	Any halloween plans?
No	Working.  But we have a mean Halloween party at work - lots of food and everyone dresses up
Yes	interesting, what other colours do you like
Yes	My favorite color used to be blue, but I started liking purple more after becoming a Prince fan. Do you like Prince?
Yes	yes, i love purple rain
Yes	That was a good movie. Did you ever get a chance to see him in concert?
Yes	sadly no, what about you?
Yes	Yes, I got to see him when I lived in NC, and took all of my grandchildren. It was a great show.
Yes	nice! do you like playboi carti?
Yes	Not a big fan, but he's okay. Are you a big fan?
Yes	yes, i love die lit and self title, do you like the young thug?
Yes	Yes, I like young thug better. Been to a concert lately?
Yes	no i haven't, what is your favourite thug album?
Yes	So Much Fun. Your favorite?
Yes	It's not that I don't like them, I just really like having room to mess around and play without bothering anyone.
Yes	I know what you mean. Like play loud music or having BBQs at night for apparent reason
Yes	Lol, I'm kind of the opposite, I like building projects and the noise can bother people sometimes. I also like the quiet so I can focus on my hobbies.
Yes	What's your hobbies? I like to go hiking on the weekends
Yes	you knit? That's awesome.  How long have you done that?
Yes	it's been about 2 years now or more. when i got my cat speckles i would sit by the window with him for hours on end sometimes. Hows your garden?
Yes	My garden is just lovely but this rain has been a real damper on it.
Yes	 I understand. I don't like bad weather either. It looks like rain here today too I hope not alot, I want to visit a roftop patio for drinks later!
Yes	Sounds like fun.  What do you like to do in your spare time?
Yes	Listening to music and playing board gameswith my cat. Like cavemen. Lol
Yes	lol now that's fun.  I like to swim and was a swimmer back in my college years.
Yes	oh you are a swimmer? me too! were you ever on a swim team?
Yes	Yes I was.  It was a great experience.  Were you on a swim team as well?
Yes	ehh I am an ok swimmer enough to keep me alive lol but never enough to be on a team. It was more of a hobby, are you still swimming?
Yes	Yes, but I would have to go overseas.
Yes	I'm truly sorry to hear. I have a reddish-brown hair color so I always feel discriminated against when I'm passed over for others at work.
Yes	I'm sorry that you feel this way.  I am a heavy set women and feel the same way so I completely understand ya.
Yes	But all we can do is push on. I feel as if eventually they will realize they made a serious mistake.
Yes	yes most definitely.  
Yes	Like, I broke my arm in a skiing accident and thought I'd never be useful again. Now my arm is 100% and I feel like it never happened.
Yes	 That is wonderful! I have MS and because of it have fallen several times and messed up my hips and back.
Yes	I hate hearing that. How long does it take you to recover from a fall?
Yes	I have been doing therapy for about 3 months now.  I am slowly coming back around.
Yes	Well I wish you a speedy recovery. I've heard using parallel bars for walking is the best form of PT in your situation.
No	Thank you, Don't you think the same?
No	Yes, I do believe that everyone has a purpose.  I once fell up an entire flight of stairs with only a bruise or two, so I definitely have faith
Yes	Yes, I do love to bake, and skateboard, which is a strange combination, but I love it!
No	Those sound like 2 extreme opposites, which can be exhilarating! Creating a cake, pleasure to others, and skateboarding. . . wow
Yes	Yes, the cool part is you get to wear grungy clothes for both!! I don't even have to change:)
Yes	LOL! Well, as a baker, I'm sure you have to be a taster as well. Skateboarding sounds like it keeps the pounds off. I'm watching the figure myself.
Yes	Hahaha! I do eat a lot of cake and it does help. Are you trying to fit into a wedding dress? Maybe it's your cake I'm baking..lol
No	I wish! :-D How soon do you have to bake it? How long does it take? Do you already have a design in mind? sounds like a fascinating career.
Yes	I have to make it by Friday, the wedding is Saturday! It takes a few days to construct. It will be a 3 tier cake with champagne fountain!
No	Yummy! Well more power to you! side job - or professional [went to school for it]/career?  
Yes	Thank you! I went to school for 4 years at Johnson & Wales University in Rhode Island.
Yes	well, I'm not doing much these days, except job hunting myself. your life/career sounds fascinating. I'm proud of you -& don't even know you :-)
Yes	I have chronic back pain too. It can be frustrating. How long has it been going on?
Yes	It has probably been about 8 months are so
No	Wow, that's a long time. Have you seen a doctor to find out what might be causing it? Mine is a pinched nerve from a slipped disk. 
Yes	I have seen a doctor today. He give me lab tests to do but I am afraid of the results.
Yes	The waiting is the worst part if you ask me. The uncertainty. Did the doctor do any imaging tests?
Yes	Well the MRI was clear but my mother has MS and it can be diagnosed with an MRI - so it was a bit nerve wracking to say the least.
No	Yes, I have MS but not spinal, I actually suffer from the brain lesions. Luckily it hasn't flared up since 2017
No	that is quite interesting , have you ever thought of having it removed ?
Yes	I've only had one flare up so it's early at this point, but I will if it does flare up 
No	i heard the procedure is painless . 
Yes	I am a nurse. What about you?
Yes	That's cool. I have worked in a hospital as a nurse before. Currently I am and LPN in school to become a RN.
No	Thats awesome! It's a lot of work, but very rewarding. Do you like to travel?
Yes	Yes I do my next vacation is actually in 6 weeks to Europe for the holidays. Do you love to travel? 
Yes	Yes I really do. I want to go to Rome, but I am scared to go alone.
Yes	 how you feel! This was my fear at first but I book those flights and go. I want to learn how to fly a plane soon lol.
No	Wow that sounds really fun. I would like to do that too, but not sure I could. 
No	Listen I am scared but it's on my bucket list and I just have to lol!!! Do you have crazy things on your bucket list? 
Yes	I don't know. I really want to go skydiving. Have you ever been?
Yes	No I have never jumped out of a plane. I am too scared although I like parachutes and their light and strong fabric.
No	I think you might like them if you were to try them. 
No	is there a certain way i should prepare them?
Yes	I prefer to saute them, but a lot of people like them in salads. 
No	Sauteed? Do you eat them alone?
No	I like to stir in onion, garlic and red pepper flakes while they are cooking.
No	Do you have a favorite recipe with them?
No	Yeah, I really love sautÃ©ed dandelion greens with eggs in the morning. 
Yes	Sounds good, i rarely eat breakfast. 
No	Breakfast is very important and it only takes about 10 minutes to make! 
Yes	You are right, i am always so busy in the morning. 
No	They are quick to whip up but, you can always try with a dinner recipe if your not up for cooking in the morning, 
No	That sounds better. Are you vegetarian?
No	She is the shift lead on the taco truck now!  What about yours?
No	A taco truck sounds fun! 
No	It sure is! I love tacos myself so it's great for me!
No	I like to be alone so my girlfriend and I work different shifts. She is a waitress
No	That would be nice, sounds lovely!  Does she enjoy it?
No	For the most part. She works handling a lot of cash. Can't be all bad, right?
Yes	"Not at all, I work in a ""cash only"" business myself!"
No	I say whatever brings home the bacon! 
No	As long as I'm putting food on the table nobody is asking questions.
No	As long as the bills are paid! 
No	I know that's true. But I don't think I got the time for it. Plus I like to try different food
No	There's some great cookbooks for cooking a meal in less than 15 minutes!
No	Yeah...if you have all the ingredients they want you to have...Haha! There is always 1 thing that's missing im my fridge
Yes	True, although I used some of the services that deliver the ingredients to you for a specific meal, it's really useful
No	Hmm, I never thought about that! Do you cook at home a lot? 
No	All the time, it's so much healthier and much cheaper. With some planning you can have a good variety too
Yes	That's true! What type of job do you do? 
Yes	I'm retired, so I guess that helps, means I have plenty of spare time to cook!
No	Oh that's why! I guess I have to wait quite a while to reach that time of my life...You must be very relaxed!
No	I am indeed. What do you do?
No	The Catholic Church did not help 
No	That's weird conclusion. But, Da Vinci does definitely hold secrets and died with them. He even might have created that very bizarre and undecipherable medieval book.
No	If you think about it, the Pope and his circle were opposing this new idea at the time
No	 Yes; exactly. Protestants rejected the Roman Catholic doctrine of papal supremacy and sacraments
No	Imagine how difficult it was to fight such an affirmed establishment
No	Oh yes you get it even tough they encountered various struggles following the creation of the Church of England
No	I love the fact that science is freedom. I would love to learn more but I work a lot
Yes	exactly , i am a distinguished professor and enjoy molding minds for knowledge
No	where do you teach?
Yes	I teach at a University in California
Yes	i think i waas more afraid then she was
No	I would be too, seeing that can be so scaring
No	yes it really can its a kind of situation that sticks with you for life 
Yes	Thats why I always try to avoid climbing heights, to avoid breaking anything
No	Right?!  It's a rich history
No	sure is! and there is a lot of history too begining in 1607....
No	I had no idea it went back that far.  Where did you find that information?
No	I done searches online, went to the library, and even visited some universities to see what information they found
No	Wow, you're quite the historian. I do love doing that kind of research, though
Yes	I enjoy learning about new and different things so that is a plus. Research is great, it's like putting together a puzzle.
No	I actually work in research for a living.  I think my dad gave me that love.
Yes	Your dad is a smart man, that is awesome!
No	It's a fascinating job.  I review research done in humans (you know, clinical trials) for ethics
No	That is amazing...I love that field. so many exciting new things every day.
No	I tried to be vegan, but I ended up feeling worse. Maybe i did it wrong?
No	It is not easy for sure.
No	I've read a lot about taking supplements to keep levels in check. Do you do any of that?
Yes	No, I don't take any supplements but try to be mindful of the nutrients in what I eat.
No	That makes sense. Do you have any advice?
Yes	It takes commitment and patients to experiment with foods that work for you.
No	Fair enough. Have you always been vegan?
Yes	No, only about 5 years.
No	Do you miss anything from before you were vegan?
Yes	I miss eggs and cheese the most.
No	It makes sense, most make a decision at a young age that affects them for a large part of their lives.
No	I believe it is the toughest and most important decision to make.
Yes	There should be more guidance on the matter of choosing a career. I thought my decision was going to be irreversible. 
No	there are other options in life but you must always follow your heart when making such important decisions.
Yes	I disagree. Not everyone can be what they wish. Sometimes you have to follow your head, and even that doesn't always work out. 
No	I see your point.  It is a good one!
No	I myself changed the direction of my education multiple times. There were benefits but ultimately it was a mistake. 
Yes	I believe that.  I also changed directions and it put me behind many years.
Yes	It is comforting that others have similar issues. But this is why I mentioned there should be greater guidance during the early years of picking a career path.
No	Exactly it is such a crucial decision
Yes	They love softball but I used to play when I was little and got kidnapped by my uncle one day after practice so softball games make me feel sad.
No	I hear that memory isn't very accurate sometimes... maybe it wasn't as bad as I remember? Your dad is a nice guy.
Yes	Yes, my dad is a nice guy but my uncle is evil.
No	Do you have the same relationship with your Dad?
No	I should. Do you enjoy watching any tv shows?
Yes	yes I do . mostly watch what people recommend. I am horrible at finding one i like. do you have one you like?

No	it's called fear the walking dead. it's not released until 2020
No	its already out though or the show i watched was out. i wonder if this is something else. i curious to see what people would do if zombie really existed
No	i meant the newest season will be out in 2020. Yea if zombies existed in real life that would be awful so many people would die
Yes	not if your a dooms day person who has their own shelter and food ready. i loved that show as well . have you seen it?
No	Yea ive seen them with shelter. those people are well prepared
No	yes they are! i need to be friends with ones just in case. or learn to use a gun
No	that sounds great, do you have any pets?
Yes	I have two cats, they are my favorite type of pet. And an aquarium. It's hard being away from them when I travel, which I also love doing.
No	I  bet, where have you travelled too?
Yes	Oh lots of places. My wife is from Philippines so we like going there. Also have been to other countries and national parks I love. You?
Yes	I haven't travelled much but I did recently go to Dubai which was nice. What's your favourite national park?
Yes	Dubai is very progressive. I have been to Bahrain, sort of close to there. I enjoyed Yellowstone the most so far of the national parks!
Yes	I would love to travel some more, especially to National Parks. Did your wife like it?
Yes	We were not yet together when I went there actually, but she definitely wants to visit, and to others such as the Grand Canyon and Smoky Mountains too.
Yes	Oh nice, I want to visit the Grand Canyon one day, hopefully soon!
No	That one is number one on our list to see! Do you have pets also?
Yes	yes, i love them so much
Yes	Me too. They really are a man or womans best friend. I love dogs to death and have one of my own. Do you have any dogs?
Yes	yes, i love dogs too
Yes	We humans really owe them a lot of thanks as they are our companions and friends and even work for us but dogs do all this with love.
No	yes, you are right
Yes	yes , life is wonderful and we need to be grateful .
Yes	yes, i love life

Yes	Yes I love veggies but I love my meats more. Lol
No	Agreed. Do you wake up very early for your job?
Yes	I wake up around 6 am. What time you get up?
No	Who has that kind of money to just move to a different country thought?
No	If you work hard at you can someday. So just about anybody.
No	I'm gonna disagree. Its hard to get ahead, even when your work hard. 
No	I would forces on what you have in front of then when that finish you can did travel. it call saving up.
Yes	Maybe I'll just move to a remote area, build a small cabin and live off the land.
No	That's a nice thing to do. But it can be very pricey at the start tho.
Yes	That's true. Maybe I'll start out in a tent lol.
No	Just look for an old cabin for sell then fix it up.
No	That's a good idea. Fixing it up slowly wouldn't cost so much up front. 
No	Sounds good, you can start a green house/ garden to cut down the cost of food.
No	i'm not really good at playing the game.  i just like the challenge.
Yes	my little brother loves cod!!! hes good too!!
No	wow! what made your little brother like cod?
No	I bought it for him and he just played a lot!! plenty of time in chicago to game when it snows!
No	oh!  that would explain it.  who is his favorite avatar?
Yes	he likes the modern players, donald i think!
No	mine is ghost.  ghost might be the reason why i fail at winning. lol.
No	thats crazy, do you play any other games!?
No	something corny. bedazzled. 
No	yea its tough to find time for too many games! maybe we can play someday
No	I know but I was desperate.
No	I mean, I get desperate times, but is there not a church or something in your area you could have turned to for help?
No	Well, I did. they told me that they won't pay me to travel to Nashville.
No	Why do you need to travel to Nashville?
No	One of my dreams is to become a country music star.
No	That's cool. How much did you steal from the old lady? Enough to buy a bus ticket?
No	Not really. After spending part of the money in a bar to watch some football on t.v., I barely had anything left.
Yes	Sounds like money poorly spent.
Yes	Oh no! Not at all! The Packers were playing.
Yes	Oh no, a Packers fan? Go Patriots!
No	I respect the Patriots, I lived in Boston for a while.
No	What was it like? I've never been
Yes	She's a few months old. I am Mary from Colorado. What is your name?
Yes	Jeff, actually in the UK so a good distance from you. ;o) I would love a dog, I think it might make me exercise more
Yes	Awww wow you are a distance a way lol. Exercise is great I enjoy hiking in the summer. What do you prefer?
Yes	Well, I don't really know what I prefer yet as I'm just starting a health drive - after giving up smoking recently
No	Oh wow, that is amazing. Congratulations on your continued health journey. Quiting anything can be really hard.
Yes	Thanks, I am rather proud as it was tough. What do you do in the winter though, if you hike in the summer only ?
Yes	You're very welcome. I like to go skiing in the mountains and relax at my cabin by a nice fire with a cup of hot cocoa.
Yes	OOoooo that sounds idyllic. I wonder if I could persuade my friends to go with me to do that? I go on holidays with them, but have never tried skiiing.
Yes	Yessss, persuade them to do so lol it is amazing. We only get one life so we might as well enjoy it, right?
No	Even if a leg or two gets broken - yes lol Can you take your puppy/dog with you to the lodge ?
Yes	Kinda both. We go to every rage metal concert in the area and we drink before we get to the bar, its cheaper.
Yes	I understand. After work days, I purchase my dog a dog biscuit, but I like to have a beer myself lol.
Yes	We skip the beer and go strait to Jack. That always gets people talking. I pretty much have all my friend's mental issues figured out.
Yes	lol, I bet! I like drinking harder stuff if I'm under a huge amount of stress also, but usually just unwind a little with beer.
Yes	Beer is good for a slower burn for sure. I enjoy psychoanalyzing my buddies after a throwing a few back. We have made many breakthroughs after a 12 pack.
Yes	Any other hobbies? My wife and I enjoy going to see a movie at least once every two months in the theater. 
Yes	I have been trying to learn guitar. I like writing lyrics so it seems like the logical next step. 
Yes	That sounds great. I have always had a slight interest in learning electric guitar but for now I just play air guitar.
Yes	Hey, that is a respectable skill! You can't help but air guitar at a good rage metal ballad.
Yes	lol, right on! I do air guitar a lot listening to classic rock and that includes some hair metal and monster ballads.
No	It would have been much easier if he was a Ford Truck Man!
No	Ford is what made him famous! Also, Ford have a 8% stake in Aston Martin too?
No	That's incredible. If I had a stake that large, only my three ex-wives would benefit. 
No	I've heard his net worth is like $20.9 billion dollars!!  I wish I was him too !
Yes	I wish I had a net worth of just $20! Divorces are very expensive. 
Yes	They are! My mom sometimes jokes that she should have gotten an annulment to make their marriage null and void, but I don't think she means it.
Yes	At least I have my fancy Ford truck. It gets me where I need to go.
No	They do have really good body styles.
No	The towing capacity is fantastic. Pulls all my marriage baggage no problem!
No	That's funny st least you can laugh about it.
No	oh, that's right! I like fishing, but I usually just slap a worm on a hook. 
Yes	"Same here. I generally take my dog ""socks"" with me when I go fishing. He loves the water."
No	I usually just bring my cooler full of beer. How did Socks get his name?
No	"Not sure. I ""adopted"" from someone else and he was already named. Do you have pets?"
Yes	Nope, no time for pets. Too busy fishing. 
No	Ok, that's cool. What do you drive? I get to drive around in a silver lexus.
Yes	I drive a ford pick-up. It is good for driving around on the backroads. I take it to the creek sometimes, so I wanted something I could get muddy. 
Yes	That makes sense. I would feel pretty powerful in something that big.
No	What else do you like to do for fun?
Yes	I like the outdoors so hiking is another favorite activity of mine.

No	I believe it was $2.58 per gallon when i fueled up my honda last.
No	I paid a $2.30 day before yesterday.That is pretty high but could be worse like 
No	That's really interesting, does this mean you're an expert?
Yes	I'm not an expert in Salsa.  I like to watch it but I have no rhythm at all.  Do you like to dance?
Yes	I'm not very good, but I do find it's a good way to meet new people!
Yes	What type of dancing do you do?  Have you ever tried Salsa?
Yes	I tried it once, but my hips just aren't up to it! I prefer Swing dancing - how about yourself?
Yes	Swing looks fun too!  I like watching lol, but if I had to pick anything it would probably be swing as well.
Yes	Yeah it is really fun, although I'm really a bit too tall for that style of dancing - lots of crouching required!
No	You just need to find a taller dance partner, that might help a little anyway.
Yes	Very true, although honestly I'd prefer a night in with pizza and beer...
Yes	Yeah, I agree.  I would drink some beer, eat some pizza, and make some comics...that would be a perfect night to me.
No	Wow! Did you build that boat yourself?

Yes	Yes thats why I like cats better. 
No	that's amazing. can I bring my dogs? their pretty much my best friends.
No	Sure bring your dogs. It will give the pool boy even more cleaning to do and the more time he's here the better ;)
No	What about hiring a magician? I know a guy. he's just like penn teller. This party is going to be great!
No	I'd rather not have a party. I like to keep things intimate.

No	Very true!
Yes	My step farther ignored me for the most part , I see it as a blessing in disguise however ! Step father's am I right LOL 
Yes	Definitely the best way to look at it, a blessing in disguise.
Yes	I could never see myself considering anyone else apart from my real dad , may be old fashioned but thatâ€™s how it goes with me , what about you ?

No	Aww I am sorry that your real dad wasnt there for you . It can be really tough to deal with 
No	Very much so!
Yes	I was lucky that my mum was like an angel . How about you ?

Yes	Yes you should, Just the other day  me and my brothers ordered some for the game.
Yes	What game were you guys watching?
Yes	We were watching Worlds for League Of Legends video game, but both of them dont play as much.

Yes	Do you play Fantasy football?

Yes	yes, we went to the bahamas too...for my other daughters wedding...been hitting those HOT places lately! lol
Yes	Yeah, you must have spent a fortune on sunscreen lol
No	You beetter believe it, at least no one got burnt.
No	That's good, if you don't shell out on sunscreen your wallet will feel it later when you have to shop for aloe
No	Well since we both hate it, what exactly do you like to wear?
Yes	Im a fan of cosmetics that can help enhance or alter the appearance of the body.
No	So weight loss/gain supplements?
Yes	yeah , you cannot just selectively tone . its a fully body and mind experience
No	truth, so you like to workout and keep the body in balance and working order?
Yes	I do! I am into yoga and running a lot
No	Never got into the yoga experience but I can see where that will help with balance of the mind and body
No	It is great because anyone at any age can do it. 
No	Same with working out or running. Just the pace and amount you do will differ with age.
No	Exactly! Since I moved here I don't know many gyms around here but i can do both of those myself
Yes	it was very embarrasing, wont be going back there!
No	I'm sure he won't make that mistake again.
Yes	i would hope not, they gave me a free meal but it wasnt nearly worth what the suit costs
No	Sounds like you'll need to find a new date spot.  Maybe somewhere near the beach.
Yes	I love the beach, we can get there using a train
No	Yes, ease of access is one of the perks of living in a coastal area.
Yes	i like books about trains too
No	Interesting.  Since you seem to like trains - did you know there is a band called iLIKETRAiNS?  They're an English rock group.
No	they cound really cool! I like thomas the tank engine but will give that band a listen
Yes	Do you happen to have children who like Thomas, or are you personally a fan?
No	Have you ever tried to play a trumpet?
No	I haven't, but maybe I'll give it a try!
No	It's great fun. I also enjoy playing other instruments. Not ones traditionally used for signaling though.
No	Alrighty then!  Maybe I'll give it a shot!
No	What activities are you involved in?
Yes	I really enjoy aquatic sports. I love the ocean!
No	Oh cool. I've thought about joining my school's swim team, but am too nervous to try. Definitely wouldn't be in the ocean!
No	have you swam before?
Yes	Yes. I do enjoy swimming during the summer months to cool off, but don't think I would do well competitively.
No	practice can always help . but i'm sure competition might be intimidated .
No	Probably cruising in my mustang! what about you?
No	IÂ´d love to get in the mountains and check any tree leaves still changing colours.
No	I love the cold weather, would move there in a heartbeat.
No	Oh, not me. I'd much rather live in a warmer climate, but it would be nice to visit once.
No	I wonder if there is n ice bar there?
No	There's gotta be. Gotta have a nice place to stay warm at drink at. 
No	Where would you live, if you could up and move?
No	South. Way south. Somewhere where is warm all the time, preferably by a beach.
Yes	That sounds nice, never been able to enjoy the salt life, really prefer doom and gloom. 
No	You sound like you'd be fun at parties lol.
No	Right! That's another reason I would love Iceland, less people.
No	You've got a point there. I would like dealing with less people too. 
No	That it is! You are what you eat right?
Yes	You know that's right.  I love food, although I just recently became a vegan.
No	What inspired you to make the change?
Yes	I have been having some health issues and wanted to try to eat better to improve my health.
Yes	I have been having health problems as well. I have thought about making further changes to my diet. Has it helped?
Yes	Definitely! My health got better and I feel better in general.
No	That's great to hear! Maybe I will put some more thought into giving it a try myself
No	You need to be sure that it's a well balanced diet so you get all the nutrients you need.
No	That's what has left me hesitant because I'm concerned I won't be able to get everything I need
No	Well if you eat right you can reduce the risk of disease like heart disease.
No	Do you live near the beach?
Yes	I used to, but my girlfriend and I just bought a new house that's closer to her parents
Yes	I've never lived more than 30 minutes from the coast
No	Oh wow, that's pretty cool. Do you go to the beach often?
Yes	I like to run and I try to run on the beach at least once a week
Yes	I used to run, but now I spend most of my time taking care of my pregnant girlfriend.
No	Yea it can be hard to find time but it's so worth it if you can manage
Yes	Once the baby is born hopefully we can take it to the beach
No	When is she due?
Yes	Three months! We're counting down the days.
No	Yes to just be able to build memories and be surrounded by love is so exciting. Oh and to eat we love doing that. lol
No	Its such a god chance to get a break while exploring such vast scenery 
No	I have to agree with you on that one what holiday is your favorite? 
Yes	probably the one across the USA where I went to loads of concerts, I love playing the guitar!
Yes	How long have you been playing the guitar are you in a band? 
No	I am not in a band but I have been playing for about 4 years, do you play an instrument?
Yes	No I was never the instrument type I almost flunked band in high school lol. I do like the piano but just can't play at all. 
Yes	Awww that's a shame, its amazing being able to connect to the music
Yes	I know like I want to learn piano because I desire it but at this age I feel like my brain can't handle learning the keys and notes lol. 
No	I understand that, it can be difficult and quite difficult to pick up and not everyone has it you know ... Do you have any hobbies?
No	Yea I am trying to help her everytime I can also it help me collect enough money for my goal.
No	That's cool, what are you trying to collect money for?
No	buying huge macaroni bag at costco to make macaroni art. 
Yes	Oh wow! I love macaroni, but usually with cheese:) I would probably eat my art.
No	ahah yea thats the hard part about this hobby. Not eating your project..
Yes	Well, if you did eat it, I wouldn't judge you! What type of art do you create with the macaroni?
No	Contemporary art, its hard to explain. I paint each macaroni individually and make things like bridge and dog
Yes	I can dig that! I saw a piece of art yesterday that was made out of individually splash painted toy soldiers! Who can judge art.
No	oh yea I know this piece of art. Its in one of the encyclopedia I am selling with its history and creator biography. 
Yes	Really, wow, I've had the same job for eight years and this is the first time I've seen anything like it. I guess I need to get out more.
Yes	I do not have many friends so I spend a lot of time with my 2 dogs and cat.
Yes	I have 4 cats and planning to get a puppy in a few months. Have you had your pets since they were small?
No	I have one of the dogs since I was 16. I rescued the other dog and cat after I finished college.
Yes	Rescues are always great! I have one rescue cat
No	Oh yes, they are my little friends and we live in our own little fantasy world. Just us. Haha.
No	Sounds cozy. I usually prefer to hang out with animals over people as well. :) Do the dogs and cat get along well?
Yes	Oh, they are best friends. I made sure when I adopted them they were okay around each other. My other dog eventually warmed up to them.
No	I am a little worried because my cats are pretty content with no other animals around. They've never been around dogs, so not sure how they'll react to a puppy
No	I think they will eventually warm up to them. You may have to get 2 dogs so they can play with each other and won't bother the cats.
No	Oh man. I haven't had a dog since I was a teenager, so I'm nervous enough about getting one. Cats seem easier.
No	wow, impressive.  did you decide to change careers?
Yes	No, the office job is just to get me through my radiology studies. What do you do?
Yes	When I get anxious I usually go work in my garden.
No	That is a good way to relax and give your mind a break. How big is your garden ?
Yes	it's about 10x12 feet, just a backyard thing. 
No	What kind of plants do you have ? Any vegetables ? Does it receive direct sunlight ?
Yes	it's all vegetables, season is almost over though. Last thing I had was pumpkins. 
Yes	Pumpkins are very nice but they take a lot of space. For my anxiety I like to visit museums, art in general relax me.
No	I have you ever been to the MET in NYC?
Yes	Yes, several times and believe me my anxiety was gone during the hours spent there. 
Yes	I used to go there all the time when I was younger. To the Guggenheim too.
Yes	It is nice to live in NYC, you have so much to enjoy. 
No	True, but I didn't always have it and many people don't
No	i think you are good at advising clients on legal transactions
No	Thanks, that's nice of you to say
Yes	i like lawyers profession as they bring back justice.
No	Yes, that's why I became a lawyer. What do you do?
Yes	im studing in law school...
No	That's great, how are you liking it?
Yes	im doing good in studies ..
No	I'm happy to hear it, what area of law are you leaning towards going into?
Yes	bussiness law..im also interested in criminal law
Yes	I wish I had more money to travel, because that is my dream. 
Yes	I'm not great at saving money to travel, but it would be nice.
Yes	No, I went to my neighbor's house and wiped it on their porch
No	LOL! I bet your neighbors were happy to have such a beautiful edition to your neighborhood.
Yes	They better. I am sick of them waking me up in the morning. That's what they get
Yes	Ugh, that is inconsiderate of them. What do they do?
Yes	They are always up blasting music super early. I dont know why they cant just wear ear buds
No	That's stupid. 
No	Yeah. When do you usually wake up?
Yes	Usually around noon, so I can spend my afternoons watching tennis and golf on tv. 
No	That sounds relaxing!
Yes	It is! I hate leaving the house. 
No	No. It was just fogy and dark.
No	what in the world scared you ?
Yes	I went to London. It was super fun but walking through the side streets at night with fog creeping in was scary.
No	Did you fly to London?  I hear it has the busiest airport system in the whole world!
No	Go camping, do a little fishing. Do you like to fish?
Yes	I did when I was younger but I am far too old now.
No	I didnt think you could get too old lol 
Yes	I'm in my early 90's, so if I fell out of the boat I'd be meeting Jesus!
No	what do you like to do for fun?
Yes	I like to walk my dog and play with my grandchildren and great grandchildren!
No	Fun! How many grand babies?
Yes	Seventeen!
No	i like to play tennis
No	Cool! That's a good workout. How long have you been playing?
No	two years
Yes	And is that what you blog about?
No	yes
Yes	I've been playing a lot of squash to get in shape. I'm going to start training to be a police officer this summer.
No	okay good 
Yes	what's your angle on your blog? Liike, do you give tips? Or talk about what's going on in the sport? Something else?
Yes	now i will go lunch. after the lunch i will give tips
Yes	Good call. I'm getting hungry, too.
Yes	My dog is as well. And he even likes his clay model. lol I've also made a clay model of mount Everest as I hope to climb it someday!
Yes	Wow, that would be a huge accomplishment if you did it!
Yes	Indeed. Although it would take a long time to prep considering the danger and conditions, ya know?
Yes	That is true! I bet it is taking a lot of time, but accomplishing that would be entirely worth it. 
No	So true. It's just too bad I couldn't take my dogs with me, right? Ha!
Yes	haha definitely not! That would be way too dangerous. So what else are you into?
Yes	I enjoy a nice classic movie every now and again. Matter of fact, I watched Gone With The Wind recently and it always makes me cry.
No	Oh okay! I've always heard about it, but unfortunately have never watched it. I love movies in general though. 
No	"at 7:00 and now its 9:00, the person who was serve had an ""emergency"""
No	I hate when that happens. Life is so unfair.
Yes	It is! but lately I've been trying to roll with the punches but it's just to hard sometimes.
Yes	It is. Have you tried yoga and meditation?
Yes	no but i always wanted to. is it really worth it?
Yes	I think so. It helps me relax after a hard day at school.
No	maybe i will have to try it. just afraid that it will be wasting my time if it i don't see results.
Yes	The stress needs to go. Everything is temporary! What do you do for fun?
No	"very true, and is work considered ""fun""? haha"
Yes	I guess, if you like your job! What do you do? I'm keeping my grades up because I want to be a veterinarian.
Yes	I planned my first cruise to Alaska
Yes	Your first cruise? Or first one to Alaska?
Yes	Both!  Im so excited
Yes	A cruise would suit me well. I only eat fish, so I'd fit in nicely.
Yes	I love fish.  I like to fish and eat them.  I am primarily a fish eater myself.
Yes	I'm on a weird diet where the only thing I can eat is fish. I'm kind of sick of it.
Yes	Some fish are great for you.  They say that everyone should incorporate it in a weekly diet.
Yes	Yeah. I forget what it is they have. Oxy-something or something. But it's hard because of all the media that says how dangerous it can be.
Yes	Very true but the media likes to over exagerate things also.  I would recommend eating what your comfortable with and what our body is going to handle.
Yes	Well, I'm a Democrat. So I kind of trust the news.
Yes	I will try to keep that in mind. 
Yes	Thank you for the advice. Next time, I'm gonna follow that
Yes	I really would like to have a pool for the hot summers though. 
Yes	Yes, me too. I just like to stay in the pool for a long time doing nothing
Yes	After working at the zoo all day it would be nice to come home and jump in the pool. 
Yes	If I have a pool, I would never get out if it 
Yes	Actually my wife works at the zoo with me, it would be great for both of us.
No	That's good, You're a one lucky person
Yes	I do feel lucky that my wife and I both share a job that we love. 
Yes	Yes, It's easy and helpful to both of you guys
Yes	never got into online games, there isn't any I'm interested in
No	There are online games for pretty much anything that interests you.
Yes	I'm really into bowling - are there computer games about bowling?
No	Absolutely. Actually some pretty good ones.
No	wow, maybe I should check one sometime. are there any that you play?
Yes	I love the online card games.
No	I've never been a fan of card games - I find them kind of boring.
No	I get it. I find Bowling kind of boring.
No	lol, fair enough. what else do you like to do then?
Yes	I love taking vacations to the Caribbean.
Yes	I don't know? I guess school and stress just gets to people sometimes.
Yes	Yeah it can be more than a normal temporary reaction to life events. Although I try to keep perspective like a lot of people struggle with this and worse problems.
Yes	I know. Just hard to believe that my roommate would be rummaging through my things. I wonder if she has been stealing from me?
No	its totally possible. Did you get to find out why she did that?
Yes	I haven't spoken with her about it yet. I just caught her on video going through my desk. How do you bring something like that up?
No	definitely possible
Yes	I don't like confrontation, and this is not a discussion I am looking forward to having. But I have to stand up for myself.
No	have you tried confronting her?
No	I tried to bring it up yesterday but she was in a hurry to get out the door.
No	i'd suggest you find a time you're sure she's not going out and talk about it
No	That makes sense. Vigilance is a great preventative. 
Yes	I am a security guard so it is very important.
Yes	Are you concerned that you are going to be replaced with a security robot? I listened to a great 99% Invisible about them plus a documentary called Chopping Mall.
Yes	I have never thought of that. I just finished training so I should be ok for a few years.
Yes	Yeah I think you've got a lot of time. I worry about AI. I don't think that it'll be like Star Wars at all.
Yes	I think in the long run it will benefit society but there will be some issues along the way. 
No	There are just going to be tons of lost jobs and AI often has so much bias built in from the coding and learning process.
No	Yeah that could be an issue. How do you think governments and people can prepare?
No	we need to regulate the jobs that can be automated, we need a robust UBI and social safety net, and companies need to be much more careful about developing them.
No	That definitely makes a lot of sense. 
No	What do you mean by off the chains?
No	Just crazy songs in general I think! Like rock, pop, and hip pop
Yes	Huh! Ive never been too big of a fan of those genres but they arent bad!
Yes	Sometimes you have to be in the mood, but overall I love those genres
Yes	Well speaking of things we like, how do you feel about nascar?
Yes	I think it would be fun to attend once or twice, but I think thats about it?
Yes	Hm personally I love watching it. Best way to spend a sunday afternoon
Yes	Yeah my dad loves to watch it too haha!
Yes	Oh! neat, your dad sounds like the kind of person I would call a friend
Yes	Yeah he is a great guy, I hope to be like him one day.
Yes	Oh where do you go for work? Is it that bad? 
Yes	I dont hate the job, but I really just dont want to do it for the rest of my life
Yes	Oh that's a bummer. Maybe you can join me at the military. It's a great exciting job with good benefits and purpose.
Yes	Thanks, But I would rather be a video game developer
Yes	Oh have you always wanted to be one? Were you an avid video gamer?
Yes	Yea, since like forever
Yes	Oh I never knew that! Maybe you can help develop a new baking game! One that teaches how to many good brownies!
Yes	Now thats an idea Hahaha.
Yes	Yup. I am sure with your talent you can make it happen! Maybe we work together even in the future!
Yes	That would be cool!
No	Did you enjoy it?
No	Yes, I really enjoy the JRE. I hate sitting in traffic, it makes me pretty mad so the podcast makes it a little more bearable.
No	Yeah its a good duration and so interesting it takes your mind of the pain of driving haha 
No	I'm glad you can relate haha. Do you listen to any other podcasts?
Yes	Yeah I listen to a couple of others.  I am always on the look out for a good one.
Yes	When do you like to listen to podcasts? I like to listen to them when I'm cleaning the house as well, makes time pass quicker.
Yes	im at home, whether i go home or out i have an amazing view of the mountains since that where i live
No	that's great , i wish i had a view of the mountains .
No	It's worth it since i don't have a tv to watch
No	Do you hike up those mountains? 
Yes	yes i love to hike. you?
Yes	Most people hike in groups or with friends, but I myself love to hike alone. I just love taking in the experience in my own little world
Yes	i agree its amazing alone. but i do enjoy it with my wife
Yes	I'd hike with a wife too if I had one. When I try to find a soulmate it always ends up being someone I should never have trusted.
No	how about a pet?
Yes	I thought about it, but dont think I could handle one. Do you have one?
Yes	and i work as an accountant
No	how do you enjoy working as an accountant?
Yes	i do enjoy dealing with money,lol!
Yes	well you and I have that in common! however I am not overly financially literate, I don't think I could do that job
Yes	why? though you need to be highly literate to do accounting it needs a lot of operations
No	I have heard sometimes it can be boring
Yes	yes it can..you know doing same routines everyday for many years.
Yes	yes, I like having a new challenge everyday in my work
No	yes we all could love that.but it happens very rarely.
Yes	I find being a software engineer always makes me think in new ways, I enjoy it
Yes	It is okay. I will find another job.
Yes	If you feel ready for a promotion then, yeah, time to look further afield then. I am going to start looking when both my kids are at school.
No	How is your job market? I live in New York so mine is pretty good and leaves me some room for a career switch
Yes	NOt great, I'm very rural and without travelling there is little to go for that is well paid. 
No	Do you like to travel?
Yes	NO, not really, and certainly not in terms of commuting. Well, we will see what turns up. Have you got any hobbies ?
Yes	I enjoy traveling to different countries. I am going to visit my best friend in Japan soon
No	AH ok, thats why you asked about travelling. Japan sounds fascinating, have you been before ?
No	No, this is my first time,
Yes	They are very very good at something I have an interest in , Robotics, world leaders
Yes	This is making me hungry for pizza, its my favorite!
Yes	Me too! I love a cheesy pizza! What's your fave topping>
Yes	Mine is cheese too! I guess that's why I love being a waiter because of food.
Yes	Even better with cheese in the crust too! Do you eat good then?
Yes	Yes I agree! I do but I try to watch my waist line too lol 
Yes	I hear ya, must be careful with so much good food available
Yes	Yup and especially if its good food that's my weakness!
Yes	I'm the same, I even love a good salad!
Yes	Same here you need to get your daily dose of some veggies to have balance.
Yes	Yep, and then one sweet a day for dessert
No	where did you learn to fix rigs? 
Yes	Its self thought. I worked so much with trucks. I know everything about them
No	What kind of things did you transport when you drove your big rig? Butterflies?
Yes	I was transporting huge wood logs around America.
No	I see, what was the wood going to be used for? I bet the butterflies will miss them.
No	All sort of thing from furniture to paper. Butterflies are living more in meadows than forest. So no real harms was done.
Yes	Thank you for expanding my knowledge of butterflies! I love them so much. You know, my favourite hero Flash could assemble furniture in a flash.
Yes	Is flash part of the avenger? I don't have a lot of knowledge in super heroes
No	I think he is part of the Marvel universe, but not an Avenger. Sometimes I get DC and Marvel superheroes confused. I am ashamed I do not know this.
Yes	They all confuse me. I was a big fan of x-men though when I was younger.
No	I thought so. My doctor, not so much.
No	I hope you don't get any bad news from the doctor.
No	It wouldn't be the first time. He told me he likes country music and that almost killed me!
Yes	Do you like cars? I have a black mazda that i love
Yes	I drive a red mazda!
Yes	how long have u owned that car for?
No	A few years, had to drive it up from Florida though. I hate hot weather. 
No	I live in Florida. It's so hot. I'm a military recruiter so I know that feeling
No	The heat is the worst. I'm sure it's bad when you go out recruiting.
No	It's even worse for the soilders training lol
No	Really?
No	Yes. Teaching online is quite common now. For someone who enjoy dancing like me I can do both as a job.
No	I really want to be able to travel all over the world to teach the learnings
No	That would be a nice gig. Which part of the world do you want to explore next?
Yes	Well, Spain for sure. Germany is a close second thoughg
No	Oh that's great. I wonder if that place is ashma friendly. Otherwise I would like to visit there too. 
No	I am really not sure. I would miss watching the game though. I am a Buffalo Bills fan all the way. 
Yes	Oh football. How long have you been following them?
Yes	Probably about three of four years
No	Oh. You must be a loyal fan for the kind of record they have. Have you been to a live game?
Yes	I'm only 15 so I can't have any tattoos yet. I don't think my dad want's his little girl covered in ink.
Yes	My tattoos are of cats ,my dad had tattoos he got them in Germany 
Yes	I love cats! I want to be a veterinarian when I grow up.
No	that will be cool , are you looking at any schools to go to ?
Yes	I have my eyes on a few but I have to discuss it with my parents
No	It is pretty expensive to go to get this type of schooling and it takes a while , but I feel you will enjoy it . 
No	I hope so. What do you do for work?
Yes	I am a artist and I farm I have cattle ,pigs, a few horse.It is nice
No	That seems like a good life to live to be self sufficient 
Yes	Yes it is but it is hard work, there is a lot to be done feeding wise, but artist wise I love it ,

Yes	They're ok. They have stuck with me through some tough times so I tolerate it.
No	gotta take the good with the bad i suppose
No	i agree many parents do not have enough dicipline for their children

Yes	It's been about 5 years now. I've learned so much since I first started.
Yes	Wow that is awesome! My wife and I are so busy with the kids that I don't know if I'd have time.
No	you will just have to make the time when you can . just do not miss out  on the kids.  That is most important.
No	Yes, they are definitely the most important thing in my life.
Yes	My family is important to me as well.  My father is in advertising and our relationship helped me on my you tube channel.  
No	That's wonderful your father and you share such a good relationship!
Yes	We do have a great relationship.  Are you close with your parents? 
Yes	Thanks! It's in Germany so I have to move. Luckily I already speak the language.

Yes	I'm a little nervous but I'm sure I'll be fine.
No	Relax and be yourself! I wonder what the weather is like there
Yes	"People are always asking me that... ""How's the weather up there?"" *sigh*..."
No	Is it usually cloudy in Germany? That's what I have always heard.
Yes	I'm not really sure, I guess I'll find out when I get there! Where are you from?
Yes	Im from the USA. The summers here are always sunny and hot. I wonder how summers are there... Summer's my favorite.

Yes	I used to like sports, but I dont play them anymore. I dont have the physical coordination for it
Yes	I know. It was at the end of my driveway and now its gone!
Yes	Oh no. Did you report it missing?
Yes	No, there is nothing they will do about it. But I did mention it on our neighborhood FB page, seems I'm not the only victim.
No	You should report it to your local police department. Building and documenting this can help you.
No	Really, you think I should. They will think I am crazy, it's just a trash can.
No	But it's stealing. You should install security cameras around your house.
Yes	We really do need cameras. I need to check into that ASAP.
No	I think it could help.  At least you could get an image of the perp.
Yes	So true. I deliver packages for a living so I see all kinds of security measures. 
Yes	I love our delivery guy.  I've been online shopping for more and more things lately.
Yes	So what location do you prefer to live?

Yes	Yeah, it's good that it is always on December 25th, so that I don't forget. hahaha.
Yes	Not many others do but I can run very fast and for long distances so I quite enjoy it.
No	Yeah it is amazing what happens to the body when you run, activity of enzymes and hormones that stimulate the muscles and the heart to work more efficiently.

Yes	oh nice, Every do marathons? i heard their is big events in mexico. Been there quite a lot. Even know i hate the food lol.

Yes	Just the sights and love the culture. 
No	It would be pretty awesome to go run a marathon in mexico just for the fun of it. 
No	Agreed, such a nice place!
Yes	My Father played the guitar, but he is having some health problems right now.

Yes	She means everything to me
No	It's a blessing to have someone in your life who is your best friend and also a life partner.
Yes	So true. When my mother passed she helped me through that. She is my best friend and my one true love.
No	Sorry for your loss.  I'm glad she was there to provide you support.
Yes	She has always been there for me, no matter what. That is why I will never stray.

Yes	I never had imaginary friends when I was growing up. Music was my thing. I love rap and I listen to it every day.
No	Rap is cool. I havent listened to music lately. My friends dont like it.
Yes	It is an acquired taste. I grew up on it. How's your family doing?
Yes	They are doing well. I dont get to see them often. 
No	Yeah same here, I talk to my mother by phone every day, but it is hard.
No	Yes, same. Whats the weather like?

Yes	I do not as of right now because I am in college.
No	So, you will see them soon?
No	She is always taking things.
No	Oh! I wonder why she does that?
Yes	I have no idea. We tried getting her help she won't open up.
No	That's too bad, has this been going for a while?
Yes	For a couple of months now. She doesn't want to be around. She used to love skateboarding with me it's our thing.
No	I am sorry! Maybe try to spend more time with her and get her involved in other activities?
Yes	Thank you I will try that. I just can't trust her with anything my husband wanted to remove her door. She hides things she takes in her closet.
No	She might grow out of it. How old is she again?
Yes	12. Do you have kids? They are a handful. Most days I'm in jeans and a t-shirt because I'm so busy with them.
Yes	I do not have children yet haha I am quite young still
No	Yeah? Did you know the capital city is the oldest capital in the Americas, and was first built by the Aztecs in 1325.
No	I didn't know that! Do you have any other facts about Mexico?

No	What is your favorite food from Mexico?
Yes	Definitely enchiladas. How about you?
Yes	I love them...but they give me gas! It's pretty bad. 
No	That isn't Ideal, but my mother makes ones so good it'd be worth it!
No	Enchiladas for the win! Gas never hurts anyone. Sometimes I even use my armpits to make fart noises. I can play the National Anthem with my pits. 
Yes	That's Impressive! My musical talent expands to playing the triangle, It's harder than it looks to be honest.
No	Hey, we all need our talents! How long have you been playing?
Yes	I used to work at a call center in Baltimore, it was a nightmare!
Yes	I'm from Baltimore! I loved driving in the Appalachians with my wife.
Yes	Ah, the Appalachians are gorgeous!  Just like my mustache!
No	Weird thing to say. Did you want to discuss your facial hair?
Yes	Not particularly, I just caught a glimpse of Slick Daddy in the mirror and had to mention how good he looks.
No	Do you have, like, a relationship with your mustache?
Yes	I suppose one could call it that.
No	Do you have relationships with your eyebrows?
No	Not regularly, what about you?
No	I'm particularly fond of my chest hair, actually. It's name is William.

No	yep nature is pretty awesome . the complexity of everything can humble a person .
Yes	I try to walk ten thousand steps each day. I have a little bit of weight to lose. 
Yes	Ten thousand steps a day is my goal also.  Have you tried any other lifestyle changes for managing your weight?
Yes	I have been cutting out sweets and concentrating on eating protein. 
No	Sounds like a plan! You can also try to see if there is less calorie version of foods you like.
No	Yes, but I am trying to keep to eating natural foods. As long is the food is not processed I'm all for it. 
No	Organic helps me a lot as well but unfortunately most things that are gluten free are NOT organic and I am so sensitive to pesticides
No	pizza can also have vegan cheese
Yes	Vegan cheese? Sounds delicious. I might buy a Vegan Cheese Pizza tonight after selling some clothes on facebook

Yes	Haha I have no pets so I can spend my money on all the beer
Yes	Sounds like you are also a homeless man?
Yes	Nah I have a wife, Just not a fan of animals

No	OH i am so sorry to hear that :(
Yes	Thank you for your concern. It has been hard, but I will do my best to move forward.
Yes	we dont have any pets...just husband and two teen aged boys.
Yes	Well, considering how much work a couple teen boys can be, you probably don't have any time to spare for pets.
Yes	yes...i had cats years ago before i had kids...always wanted another cat but life got so busy...maybe when they move out
Yes	Cats are great for companions once you have an empty nest, for sure. No worries, I'm sure someday you will be able to get another furry friend. :)
Yes	we all get along great....it probably wouldnt be a big deal but we have so many activities i feel they'd get neglected
Yes	 Luckily, cats tend to do their own thing, hence why they make great pets for busy people.
Yes	this is true!! you can even leave them for short periods...like overnight and they are pretty chill. 
Yes	Absolutely! Unlike dogs, who NEED you constantly. haha
No	Do you know who Adam Levin is?
No	I do not think so, is he aa singer?
Yes	Yep! He's a singer in the band Maroon 5. I am slightly obsessed with him lol

Yes	Seriously attractive! Whew! I met him at a concert last month while I was there shooting some photos for the local paper. 
Yes	You did not! How was it?

No	Yes, she's always gone to a church that met on Sundays.
Yes	Sometimes my work has to be completed on Sundays, for Monday delivery

No	I can understand that. Does the family watch football with you?
Yes	Sometimes, but I'm definitely the sports fan in the family. Do you follow any sports teams?
Yes	No, sadly, sports is not my thing. My son like to play a pick-up football game when he can. 
Yes	It's starting to get a bit chilly to do anything outside around here. It's almost time to break out the board games.
Yes	That sounds good! We like to set up a board game by the fireplace to play.
Yes	I wish we had a fireplace. That and a hot bowl of chili would make for a perfect night. 
Yes	You may want to try a video of a fireplace, playing on your TV, to make it feel that way.  The chili would be perfect!
No	Photosynthesis is an awesome process to be learned. 
No	It is, its interesting that even plants can make their own food and such
No	Roller coasters let you see the trees from a different perspective, when you are at the very top
Yes	So true! Plus you're able to see the world from a perspective you've never seen. You ever been to Disney World?
Yes	Only once, many years ago.  I was just a child.
Yes	My mother took me a lot as a kid. My dad left when I was only 5, so she took me there to get my mind off of it.
Yes	It's good to be able to lose yourself in an activity you love.  For me now, that is painting.
No	Agreed. I wish I was talented enough to paint. Do you ever paint any rollercoaster portraits?
Yes	No, I never have.  I can visualize one peeking out over the trees from a distance though.  Joins nature and civilization in a whimsical way.
No	I bet your portraits are amazing! I get as much of a thrill out of nature as I do rollercoasters.
Yes	I wish I lived near the mountains...so much more variety in nature. But I have learned to find the beauty of the plains.
Yes	You should look into Tennessee. The mountains there are majestic - plus they have plenty of amusement parks in the mountains for people like me.
No	What do you want to take pictures of?
Yes	I'm really more interested in photography right now and the electronic image sensor with its electrical charge and pixels. You know?
Yes	Hmm...that does sound interesting. I'm more interested in taking photos of the world.
Yes	WOW that sound neat, where have you been that you have taken pictures of the world?
No	Well...I haven't traveled...yet. I do take a lot of photos in the forest near my house.

Yes	It does! I live in an area that experiences all four seasons. 
No	very nice ! do you have ample time to take photographs ?

No	Ed Sheeran's songs topped the UK and Australian charts, reached number five in the US, and has since been certified seven-times platinum in the UK.
No	Yeah he's amazing. I like to write poetry and he's a very poetic songwriter. 
No	it is rare to hear of people into poetry these days .

Yes	That is amazing I love online work and ordering food online lol. Guilty pleasure is Mcdonalds
Yes	I love McDonald's also. Me and my family do lots of shopping online but making money online is new territory for us.
Yes	I think you will really enjoy it. Do you have a big family?
Yes	Nah, just a three person household right now and the family I was born with isn't really large either. 
Yes	Oh ok I have a really big family.The youngest of eight and my husband I have three kids and twins are baking in the oven lol.
Yes	Wow! That sounds more like a huge family lol. Congrats on the upcoming twins! My wife and I plan to have at least one more, two tops.
Yes	Thank you, we're really excited and decided to wait to find out what we're having. Kids are amazing aren't they.
Yes	Yes they are. It's fun seeing some of your own traits in them and then understanding why your parents yelled at you so much lol.
No	Omg, it's fun and nerve wrecking at times lol. Now I understand oh so well.
No	would drinkig a coke and having a warm home made cookie help?
Yes	No, I don't think Coke would help me right now, I probably should see a doctor.
Yes	what is the thing that is making you loose  your mind?  Right now i am baking and it is relaxing to me...
Yes	I am under a lot of stress, I usually go hiking on glaciers when I am this way, but I am not at home where I can hike.
Yes	when i need to destress i find a bakery....it makes me think of the things i like best...maybe a walk where you are will help!
No	Maybe I can find an isolated park, and try walk off my stress. Good suggestion.
No	i hope it calms you down! I need to get a fresh batch of cookies out of the oven!
No	Cookies also sound really good,I think I will find a bakery before I go on my walk.
No	maybe i will walk after my cookies cool, and take a coke with me!
Yes	I like to drink coffee or milk with my cookies, but Coke is also a solid choice.
No	yeah, and the taste great

Yes	On donation. Its not a lot, but I don't need a lot. I only eat rice with vegetables and drink only water to purify my body.
Yes	wow thats interesting. I don't think i could do that, I have a big family
No	I understand its not for everyone. If you are interested, you can start by being vegan. Its a good step in the right direction
Yes	Can't do that lol I love meat too much. I am an avid hunter, and fisherman. I live off what I harvest. 
No	Its another way of living life. We believe in reincarnation so for me, all animals are sacred.
No	I understand and I respect that

Yes	I like captain Morgan,  The cocktail originated in the early 20th century!
Yes	very cool, I like rum as well I mostly drink beer, but I like rum for mixed drinks and tequila for shots
Yes	I like Vodka, but mixed with stuff to kill the taste, I hate beer though, it is nasty to me
Yes	I don't drink all that often anymore. I used to when I was younger, but now only coup[le times a month in social situations. 
Yes	Yea it used to make me sick
Yes	You would think I'd know a lot about whiskey. I live near jack daniels, yet never been on distillery tour
No	I did not know Jack Daniels was a politician, he handed out bottles while campaigning
No	wow, I did not know that
No	Yea, isn't that crazy
Yes	I do not read very much. I like being active.

No	What is your favorite disney movie?
Yes	Fantasia, no doubt! I like the old classics, but am looking forward to the live version of The Little Mermaid
No	Me too! Did you watch the new Lion King?
No	No not yet, I'm waiting to get everyone together for that. 
No	I enjoyed it. Will you be getting Disney Plus?
No	Yes. I live with my parents in their old age, and my kids at home. It will be good for the whole family
No	There will be many things for you all to watch together.
No	Exactly! I figure that is more family friendly than a lot of alternatives I would watch on my own haha
No	Oh my! That sounds incredibly interesting but also a bit scary!
No	Yes  spiders can be scary, and best not to be bit and have to get anti-venom.
No	I find spiders interesting when I see them outdoors in their habitat but when I see one in my house I don't like them at all.
No	Some spiders have spots like the freckles I have, its crazy.
Yes	That's funny. We have brown recluse spiders in the area where I live. They have a tiny shape like a fiddle on their backs.
No	Scarry. My friend is from tanzania, and they have big Baboon Spiders that can really hurt you.
No	I do remind myself of their good qualities. I like the fact that they eat other bugs, keeping them at bay.
No	I agree, they play a major role in the world keeping incects at bay.
No	It's pretty amazing the way nature functions. I am fascinated by all the creatures and beauty around us.
Yes	I am as well, but I will always still be nervous around the spiders tho.
No	No just someone I saw on the train 
No	It happens, whether you're pretty or not. Lol.
No	I was so embarrassed 
No	I would be too. What do you like to do for fun, do you have any hobbies?
Yes	yes I do, I like to travel and hike
Yes	I love to travel too. I went to Colorado this summer and hiked at Palmer Lake.
No	we have that in common 
No	I never thought I would like hiking but it's really a great chance to take in the beauty of nature.
No	yes that is so true
Yes	The altitude really got the best of me though, because I really wasn't quite acclimated before my hike.
No	Yes it was a terrible situation . My husband will be home from work soon and he can bury Samson, He works a telecom.
Yes	At one time I was a nurse. Death hurts the living tremendously.
No	Yes death hurts, but I think I may have hit the cat myself I am a frustrated driver. I hope she did not suffer.
Yes	I remember a time my husband hit and killed our puppy with a car. It was very hard to deal with.
Yes	Samson was a good cat and she was a orange tabby. The weather was raining this morning and I could not see the road very well.
No	I am so sorry for you. Will you and your husband bury Samson yourselves?
No	Yes we will bury her in the backyard just as soon as it quits raining.
Yes	Do you have other pets?
Yes	NO !  But I am sure we will get another cat when we can.
Yes	We now have 2 cats that showed up as strays and a dog.
Yes	do you have any kids
Yes	No, I had a vasectomy years ago
No	ouch. did it hurt
Yes	No, it just like someone pinching your elbow really hard
Yes	interesting. i'm thinking i should get one, 11 kids is probably enough
Yes	How do you afford all their stuff?
Yes	lots of passing down stuff from the older to the younger ones
Yes	O that makes sense! How many boys/girls so you have
Yes	9 girls 2 boys. I need a vacation.
Yes	Haha yea I imagine! Where would you go
No	That's always a good place for ideas! I still live with my parents but not much longer. It's just easier while I'm traveling so much.
Yes	I also love to travel, specially in the summer time
No	I travel for work mostly these days but can't wait to travel more for leisure. I most want to see the Northern Lights one day!
No	What type of work you do?
No	We rode in one once.  To a funeral.  High class.  Was afraid to touch anything.
No	That is what is keeping me from purchasing one. My dog is my #1 sidekick and he sheds so that is a problem.
Yes	Dogs are man's best friend lol.  We're going to the opera next week.  Madame Butterfly.  For the 15th time.
No	Wow you must really be fans.  Is it a dinner and date night? Any good restaurant suggestions that aren't vegan?
Yes	Yes, but just a quick trip.  We're flying into NYC, staying for about 3 days.  Then back home.
Yes	I visited NYC this summer.  I liked it! I like the business of it.
No	Busy place.  Need to set up reservations at good hotels to really experience the city.  Worth the money.
Yes	Absolutely! How long is that flight from where you are?
No	About 4 hours.  Driving is a nightmare.
Yes	I can imagine.. Probably about as bad as the drive from TX to California. That is brutal.
No	I love gone with the wind? do you like that movie?
No	I have never seen the movie. I'm sure I'm missing out.
No	you have to go see it. OMG!!
No	Being from TN I know I shouldve saw it by now. I'm just busy with my dog a lot.

No	Yes! He's a black lab name Scooby. He is my best friend. 
No	That is grate. i love playing with my dog.
No	What kind of dog do you have?
No	Bull Dog named Dozer 
No	That's great name for a bull dog. 
No	I agree, I wish people would take more care
No	I wish there was more I could do for the wild life.
No	yeah me too, I need to start eat less fish, that will help
No	It isn't healthy to eat fish more than once a week. Too much MSG.
No	then it'll be good for me too
No	Yeah, I've been trying to recycle more and use eco friendly products.   
No	Think everyone needs to make a huge effort for the environment
No	I agree. I try and do what I can. I encourage my kids too.  
No	Ah that's great
No	Its hard with our day and age. So much going on , you just have to focus on your small part as best you can ya know?
No	Ouch. how did you break it?
No	I was not paying attention and i tripped over a big piece of wood.
Yes	My husband works to work at a lumber yard and gets hurt alot.lol But thankfully he gets to retire next year so no more doctor visits for tripping,,lol
No	Thats great news, are you all planning to travel or anything?
No	Yeah,since I love to walk we are thinking of going somewhere to hike .
Yes	Thats sounds fun, and there is alot of great places to go.
Yes	we are thinking about the Grande Canyon this year.
No	I have never been there but I hear its beautiful.
Yes	I havent either but Ive allways wanted to go.So Im excited to see it in person
No	i have only seen it from a plane but that doesnt count.
No	It kind of does. just like Ive never flown anywhere ecept when i went skydiving last month .lol So i kinda flew.
No	you went skydiving? you are brave!! I cry the whole way down.
No	And you are right. Sabroso, sabroso!
No	haha. Are you into dark chocolate? 
Yes	Yes, I am. I like to eat while drinking rum from Puerto Rico.
No	Yes, perfect match
No	Are you a chocolate lover yourself?
Yes	Yes. I love it, especially in the morning after yoga
No	I know what you mean. You feel like you deserve it.
No	Yes, it is also a good way to start the day
No	Star, continue and finish. And don't forget the rum. Wink, wink!
No	haha yes, Rum is the answer. What do you do in the morning?
Yes	Oh? I'd love to hear those. Especially while I'm sitting back fishing from my boat. I love to go fishing
Yes	Fishing is truly fun. We occasionally go with my friends too. Do you go frequently?
Yes	Well, I currently work at a deli counter so I have plenty of free time. I try to go as much as possible.
No	I'd like to go fishing more but none of my friends are interested. My job gives me the opportunity to go a lot also. DO you go alone?
Yes	I sometimes take my significant other with me. It's something I enjoy being alone with myself doing. 
Yes	I would like to go someday but not alone my husband works alot so when I'm alone I have my music while fishing. Who's favorite music artist ?
No	I understand. My favorite would have to be Marvin Gaye or Tracy Chapman
Yes	I love them both omg!!! It is hard to pick one out of those to lol. I love Michael Jackson .
Yes	Michael Jackson is the name of my best friend! 
No	Are you serious that so cool. I wonder did y'all tease him growing up lol.
Yes	My son was misbehaving at the store.
No	what was the kid doing ?
No	He wanted me to open some candy up, I was buying it for Halloween.
No	Im pretty sure I did the same thing to my parent. Did he calm down? 
No	He did after a while but not before the whole store was staring at me.  It's necessary but it's so hard to give tough love
Yes	I dont have any kids, just my cat Charlie.
Yes	I love cats but we live in an apartment temporarily, my husband doesn't want any pets right now.  
Yes	Must be nice to have a family. My favorite food is pizza but having a family to cook for would be nice
Yes	The everyday hustle and bustle is hard with 2 kids, dinner, homework, bedtime and all the sorts.  Dinner is usually something easy during the week!
No	Sounds like quite the balancing act! 
Yes	i don't have any free time to read, i wish i could! I'm working on my wedding for starters!
No	Congrats on getting merried! wish i could go, i have to work all week though. 
No	what's your job like? do you ever get to rest? i can't imagine the stress.
Yes	i worked 10 hours a day, i had to make breakfist before going, but i get so tired alot having to help alot of people. 
Yes	I hear that. it's a tough but rewarding profession. i'm lucky i got off for our honeymoon to niagra falls. 
Yes	very rewarding indeed. helping people is the best and i make $20 every hour to buy whatever i need for my house. :) and Niagra sounds great!
No	$20 an hour? You deserve a raise! I hope it is. I hear it's cold this time of year.
No	yup. very cold. wish it was warmer here. :(
No	I hate the cold! But out of season trips are cheap! When are you going to take your vacation? 
Yes	about a week from November 6. but i would had to gaet back on athe 7th to help with the Doctor on heart surgery. 
Yes	Ah yes. I have played my share of video games as well. We get snowed in often in where I live in Vermont.
Yes	I like the video version because you can play anywhere, anytime. So you are an avid golf player as well? or just your friend? 
Yes	We are trying to visit all us national parks starting with ones next to golf coarses. We have been to 12 so far.
No	very ambitious! you are traveling with family then? that can be tricky - schedule and some want to rest, sleep in.
Yes	Not always family, friends mostly. What other video games are you into?
No	I looked up: Golfing in our National Parks | National Park Foundation. It seems to be quite a number of parks. Me, various - down time on flights.
Yes	Do you travel alone? Is if for work?
Yes	for work. sales person. pharmaceutical. some days hum-drum. other days, depending on location, it's a pick-me-up all by itself. :-D
Yes	Hum, do you enjoy that? Do you get to fly first class? Gotta grab joy where you can.
Yes	enjoy, mostly. first class. how about you and friends that are getting away? for how long? sounds like enjoyment. what do you do for work?
Yes	Hah, right. Sorry I don't pay attention. I'd never even heard of Bob Marley.
No	"I loved his song Starfish & Coffee when I was little! But you have to at least know ""No Woman No Lie!"""
Yes	Nope, never listened to anything but metal. Heavy music lets me cut loose.
Yes	I've only listened to alternative myself, do you recommend any artist?
No	Start with the classics. Black Sabbath, Motorhead, Metallica, Iron Maiden. 
No	Right on, I will give them a listen. How do you feel about female singers?
Yes	They are amazing. Paramore has a great vocalist. We partied hard at their recent show.
No	That's super rad! If you like her you would enjoy Cleo Sol. She isn't well known yet but she is a star in her own right!
Yes	I'll look up Cleo Sol. I'm always open to new music, I even started listening to Bob Marley eventually!
No	 We got way too much commercial garbage on the radio. I should make it my goal to promote underground artist xD
No	I don't know.  They said they looked at it as quickly as possible.  I NEED this vacation.
Yes	Where are you going on vacation? I need a vacation to stay home and work on my ebook about animals.
No	Someplace fun, I'm not sure.   A city where I can explore and maybe sleep late for a change.
No	I hope you get to do what you want and enjoy your well deserved vacation!
Yes	Thanks!   Hey, I love animals.   What is your book going to focus on?
Yes	I just want to write an interesting book about all the unique and rare animals in the world.
Yes	It sounds more interesting than what I am working on.  I have programming homework.
No	Ok. I was just saying that my work is a bit boring also. 
Yes	Some of my studies are more interesting than others. This particular coding class bores me though.  
No	Are you a college student?
Yes	Currently taking classes in computer engineering.   I'm not quite sure what my final focus will be though.
No	Good luck with whatever you decide to focus on. I am sure you will do great.
Yes	Haha, that's definitely one way of putting it. As a classically trained chef, I really enjoy working with shrimp.
Yes	Since I cut out meat, I really miss shrimp.
No	Cut out meat? Did you do it for health or ethical reasons?
Yes	A little bit of both.  I really needed to cut down on red meat especially, and I was reading about all the water it takes to raise meat.
Yes	I've heard that as well. I try not to think about it, I have male pattern baldness and the stress of things I have little control over don't help!
No	Male pattern baldness?  What's that?
No	It's basically the way a male loses hair, you start losing hair at the hairline and it keeps going up from there.
Yes	I've noticed my hair is getting thinner lately.  Never used to be a problem.  Comes with age, I guess.
No	Yup, no sense in worrying about it. Eventually i just plan on shaving it all off, at some point it's more trouble than it's worth.
No	That's not fair!  Women can't do that.  I'd have to buy a wig.
No	How do people find it religious? 
No	It's an object that you attach meaning to and believe it will help you in life. What is it that interests you?
Yes	I love Disney movies. My favorite is Tangled. 
No	It's a very good movie. I have similar hair to the main girl character. Haha
No	I have been growing mine out for a while, but its no where as long. I love braiding though. Do you know neat braids?
No	Sure I do. That's my go to hair style. What else do you love?
Yes	Well I play soccer and enjoy doing that, what about you?
Yes	i like soccer , of course . not much into music though .
No	Thats a shame there are so many different types of music. I like to listen to a little bit of everything.
Yes	I am more into crystals. They are the objects I told you about earlier. They interest me the most
Yes	Mmm, tuna! I'm a fan.
No	I saw this really good spicy tuna and shrimp recipie but i wish i could remember what site it was on. 
No	I've never tried making sushi at home, that sounds really fun! Have you ever done it?
No	I have not , but I do want to try. I have seen where you can have someone come teach you how to make it. 
No	That sounds like a great idea, I'd have to work it around my schedule (I'm a student).
Yes	oh , what are you studying to be ? I'm currently a Paramedic.
Yes	I'm studying social sciences :)
Yes	what do you like about social science?
No	Yeah it really it. It's chilly but that's how it should be on Halloween
No	Exactly! Halloween should be cold and spooky,
No	I hope we get a lot of trick or treaters. I never got to be the actress I wanted to be so I use that energy to spook the kids.
No	Do you live somewhere with lots of trick-or-treaters? It sounds like fun.
Yes	I live in a pretty busy, small city so we get a decent amount. How about you?
Yes	I live in a small town also. We have a huge skateboard park that is putting on a Halloween bash!
No	That also sounds really fun.
No	yeah ! i'm so excited . what are you going to be for halloween ?
No	I've got a particularly spooky bride of frankenstein costume
No	whata  great costume ! that is perfect !
No	The child at the school where i teach
No	That's so sad. What did she do?
No	She answered back when i told her off for pushing another child.
No	Well, she better learn to be more respectful. People won't tolerate that behavior. Do you think listening to calming music in the classroom would help with the aggression?
Yes	Maybe, calming music soothes my nerves, that and chocolate! Do you have any suggestions?
Yes	Well, my favorite band is Toto, but I don't think rock music would help! Maybe one of those YouTube videos of the ocean?
No	Good idea! I will try it next time it happens. Rock music may have them rocking out.
No	What do you like to do besides teach?
Yes	I like to read books. What are your hobbies?
Yes	I like walking my dog. His name is Toto. 
Yes	I am starting to like cooking more.
Yes	I never liked it. I burn everything!
No	Do you like cold weather? I miss seeing snow.
Yes	I love cold weather but not keen on snow. Do you like to ski? 
Yes	I have never snow skiied, actually, but I love waterskiing. Would love to try it though!
Yes	My boyfriend lives in Italy during the winter months. He likes to ski. I dont though. 
Yes	Oh yeah? What does he do? I am a public affair liaison in my job.
Yes	He is an archaeologist. Does a lot of work in Rome.  
Yes	Oh wow, that sounds fun! Indiana Jones & The Temple of Doom is my favorite movie of all time.
No	He wishes it was that exciting lol! 
Yes	I want to get a Samsung Galaxy.
No	That's a great choice. 
No	Samsung usually makes good products.
No	Yes they have had some hiccups in the past but for the most part they do.
No	I actually bought one of their TVs.
No	That must have been expensive
No	They are, but the picture is nice.
No	is it a 4K television?
No	It is. Rather nice.
No	There's a spider on my TV right now. I am terrified.
Yes	I find I need my family more now that I'm out of school.
Yes	do you have a large or small family?
Yes	2 brothers, 3 sisters
Yes	Cool, siblings can be like really good friends if they get along. I'd say me and my sister get along pretty well.
Yes	I love them all. I'm the baby.
Yes	It's awesome to have so many siblings, do they all live close to you?
Yes	They're all on the West Coast, which is horrible. I'm on the East.
No	That can be very rough. Maybe you can move there soon!
Yes	It's too fake out there. And I have my own kids, now.
Yes	that's unfortunate that they are so far, do you do family reunions yearly?
No	It was fun! Do you play any instruments?
Yes	Nah!, I don't have a 0% knowledge in it? , I'm a good tennis player
Yes	Tennis is fun! I was never any good but liked to pretend I was 
Yes	Yeah! its good to be active for a whole day, i start my day with the tennis 
Yes	I typically run to get my exercise, and chase after the kids all day 
No	Lol! i think you are very cool guy!
No	Thanks 
No	really you are a drummer?
Yes	Used to be, dont get to play much anymore. 
No	who is your favorite?
No	I wanted a new dress. But my best friend bought the dress for herself.
No	Have you thought about the same dress in maybe a different color?
Yes	I dont like to match anyone, I would rather stand out. 
No	Well I guess you have two choices. Find a different dress or a new best friend!
No	True. I guess the dress would be easier 
No	Yeah, I think so too. Best friends are hard to come by these days.
Yes	Agreed! Do you have a best friend?
Yes	Maybe one. I'm not really a people person.
No	Im the same way, thats why the dress would be easier in my case. 
Yes	How did you meet your best friend?
Yes	oh thats such a interesting fact, what is your favorite color/
Yes	Orange is my favorite color. It reminds me of fall, specifically leaves changing and pumpkins.
Yes	oh, I love fall. It honestly has to be one of my favorite seasons ever. Only thing i dont like is that I can't swim.
No	Swimming is fun, but there are lots of things to do in the fall that are just as fun.
Yes	very true, my favorite is going to the pumpkin patch, or corn maze.  What about you?
Yes	I like to take dates to go watch leaves changing. Pumpkin patches can be fun too.
Yes	What is your least favorite season?
Yes	The summer. I can't stand the heat and humidity. What is yours?
Yes	I like swimming in summer but thats about it. I have to agree the humidity and heat is just horrible.
Yes	I just want it to be spring or fall all year round. I guess I should move somewhere more mild.
Yes	Summer, i Like the the warmer weather but not when it gets too hot
Yes	I prefer it over the winter if I have to make a choice
Yes	What do you do in spare time?
Yes	Stay home and watch tv, usually i order take out. i love eating
Yes	Yeah I love eating to
Yes	what is your favorite type of food?
Yes	Pizza for sure. you?
Yes	pizza is up there for me , but i am going to have to say seafood
Yes	I like seafood too. What about seafood pizza?
Yes	better with raw seafood in my opinion, but yeah i like that
No	thats really great and would like to know more
No	Its got that small town feel, but you get all the bonus of big city living
Yes	really cool to hear. have you ever been there?
Yes	we visit a lot, my aunt lives there.
Yes	great. when was your last visit
No	last thanksgiving, i used to go a lot more but growing up and work gets in the way
Yes	okay.. how about the climate over there?
No	Reaaaaaal cold at times. Paticuarly around the holiday. Have you been?
No	no im planning to visit
No	You'll love it, pick one or two things to do but make sure you get some exploring time in
No	lol Its ok you have to start somewhere, right.
No	True!  At least I  have started I suppose.  
No	Yes , that is the hardest part, I believe.
Yes	It really is!  I once ran a mile under 4 minutes, but that was a LONG time ago!
No	well that is great time, im sure you can bring your time down with dedication
No	We will see.  Do you enjoy running?
Yes	Not much running, nut I do enjoy lifting weights
No	awesome ! whats the most you have lifted ?
Yes	265lb bench press
No	That's impressive!  Did it take a long time to be able to bench that much?
Yes	Interesting. Do they have any songs where they rap too? I like rap
Yes	I don't really like rap. No, the organization doesn't promote or work with rap music. What songs do you like?
Yes	Lots of different songs, but mainly babershop and rap. You?
Yes	I prefer oldies myself. Rap is too new for me. 
Yes	Oldies is fun to listen to when I'm sleeping or napping.
Yes	I can't listen to music while I'm napping or sleeping. I like it really quiet. But put on oldies and I start dancing!
No	How fun! Do you have a favorite dance?
Yes	I can do the twist. It helps my old body stay young. 
No	I've heard dancing  is a good workout! Good cardio
No	Yes! Not only is it good cardio but it is also good for your mental state. Makes you happy and giggly. 
Yes	No idea. I just cleaned it up
No	that's awful! have you tried calling your local police about this? :( 
No	no, I read a lot of sci fi and I try to imagine weird ways that this stuff could have happened.
Yes	i love sci-fi.although, i hope this person doesn't have powers to put trash in your truck. 
No	strange things happen and makes me wonder if people could really be that trashy. Has anything like this happened to you?
Yes	it did, while i was working at dell yesturday. the person rush and threw a empty soda can at our boss for eating his chocolate chip cookies. 
No	oh my - - -that sounds pretty crazy. Was your boss hurt?
No	yes, he's alright. he called the cops onm the guy, but sadly he escaped. he than saw the guy again at his house outting trash on his neighbor's truck. 
No	I wonder about people - - - if the police made people clean up their own mess and pay for damages it would help deter this kind of thing.
No	yes, i agree. hopefully they catch this guy. and stop this once and for all.
Yes	What do you do?
Yes	I'm in college studying music. I love death metal.
Yes	Awesome! Do you have long left before graduation?
Yes	Only four more years!
No	i dont understand what these creatures could be looking at 
Yes	It could honestly be staring at anything! My German Sheppard I think see's straight into my soul.
Yes	honestly I'm more of a dog person. my dogs crazy. haha
Yes	I can definitely relate, but Spock (my dog) definitely loves the beach. I take him surfing with me all the time!
Yes	oh thats fun!! I take my dog Dexter, to the river alot.
Yes	My friends cat's name is Dexter. Did you name him from the show?
Yes	No, I just liked the name, well famous dex may have had some minor influence.
Yes	TouchÃ©! I did love that show though. Do you surf?
Yes	No theres not really surfing where i'm from, too cold.
Yes	There is definitely fun stuff to do in the cold though, have you ever snowboarded? It's surfing on land if you ask me.
No	I din't know that
No	I was surprised that Ray Croc wasn't the person who started McDonald's originally.  He's just the one that bought it and started franchising and eventually made it famous.
Yes	Interesting. My favorite item is the chicken strips
Yes	Yes, they are good.  But I personally love when the McRib is back.
Yes	McRib is good too. Do you remember the big and tasty?
Yes	Yes, I almost forgot about it.  That was a good one.  Even better than the Big Mac in my opinion.
Yes	Have you ever dipped your fries in Big Mac sauce
Yes	No, I never thought about it!  Is it good?
Yes	very good. 
No	Well, I will have to try that during my next shift.

No	Definitely kale.  
Yes	definitely. its the closest to me so i often go there to get things
No	Milk substitute might help, have you tried that?
No	no i haven't. whats that?
No	It's an alternative to regular milk. Such as soy, almond, etc.
Yes	i'm skeptical about trying new things. I get a lot of Allergies
No	Dairy is pretty bad for your allergies as well. It might actually help you to switch to a substitute.
No	I might try it next time i go to the store
No	It would be a wise decision. So what else do you like to do in your free time?
Yes	play online games,you?
Yes	I am an amateur painter. I try to get my boyfriend into it but he isn't really a fan.
Yes	He bought tickets to a fundraising raffle. I never have that kind of luck!
No	that's awesome! what was the charity?
Yes	It was a youth sports fundraiser. 
Yes	that's a good cause!  My friend and I played a gig recently in front of a group of people that were in a football team.  
No	You're in a band? How fun!  Do you play, sing or both? 
Yes	I wish I could sing!  If only!  I actually play the drums.  My bestfriend is on bass.  I love it!
Yes	I used to be a server at red lobster. Endless shrimp was the reason why I quit :) haha

No	Yes, I have a small Boston Terrier, Ollie. He's 12 years old, but still thinks he is invincible when trying to run after cats on his leash.
No	Haha thats funny. I have a dog and two cats. My cats always gang up on my boxer. It is hilarious. 
No	I love boxers, and their cut off tails. Ollie's is the same way! I have outside cats, but they tend to stay away until Ollie's inside. 
No	I go to the gym every day, but never go running. Does it help you stay healthy?
No	It certainly does!

No	my cats are pretty lazy but my dog is high energy and i take him on at least 2 walks a day for 30 minutes each
